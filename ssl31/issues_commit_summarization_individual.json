Here's a general idea of how I might approach this:\n\n1. Read through both sets of code to understand what the method does in each version.\n2. Identify any key differences in functionality or behavior between the two versions.\n3. Condense the differences down into a single sentence that captures the essence of what was changed.\n\nFor example, if before the changes the method computed the sum of two integers using a simple addition operation, but after the changes it uses a loop to perform the same computation for an array of integers, a possible description could be \"Introduced array support to method that previously computed sum of two integers directly.\"\n\nAnother example, if before the changes the method returned a boolean value indicating whether a given string was a palindrome, but after the changes it returns the palindrome itself if it's one, and returns the reversed string if it's not, then a possible description could be \"Changed palindrome detection method to return palindrome string if it's one, and reversed string otherwise.\"\n\nHope this helps in understanding the concept! Let me know if you have any further questions or clarifications.</s> The changes refactor the method by replacing \"repoNovels: List<NovelEntity>\" in the parameter list with \"extensions: List<GenericExtensionEntity>\", and modifications were made in the implementation to use \"extensions\" instead of \"repoNovels\" for filtering and installing the extension.

Therefore, the one-line summarization of the alteration is: \"Modified the parameter name from 'repoNovels' to 'extensions' for the list of extensions in the method implementation.\"</s> The change updates the extension loading process by fetching extensions from a repository and passing it to the restoration function instead of using the backup's extensions directly.</s>"

You shouldn't use .emit or .tryEmit on a MutableStateFlow, if you need a flow where you can emit independent of the previous value, while keeping track of the last value, you should be using a MutableSharedFlow with a replay value of 1.",

Open Shosetsu\r\n2. Install at least two extensions\r\n3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)\r\n4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view\r\n5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view\r\n6. Click or tap the \"Migrate source\" overflow menu option\r\n7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nI'm getting tired from typing extra details... it should be fine.... maybe?\r\n\r\n**Device information:**\r\n - OS: Android 10 \r\n - App Version: 2.0.0-2344\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdditional context: As my grandpappy always said, \"What a load of bullshit!\"\r\n",

Identify any improved error handling or bug fixes.\n\nTry to summarize the difference in these terms.
