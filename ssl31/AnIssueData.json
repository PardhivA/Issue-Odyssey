Identify what the change does in terms of meaning and express it as concisely as possible in a single sentence.\n\nFor example, if before the changes, the method sorted an array of numbers, and after the changes, it now sorts an array of strings, you could summarize the change as: \"Changed method to sort an array of strings instead of numbers.\"\n\nAnother example, if before the changes the method multiply two numbers, and after the changes it multiplies an array of numbers, you could summarize the change as: \"Updated method to multiply multiple numbers using an array instead of just two numbers.\"\n\nPlease note that the exact summary will depend on the specific code you're analyzing.</s> I'm unable to see the specific method changes you've provided.

Could you please provide the context or a description of what the changes entail?
