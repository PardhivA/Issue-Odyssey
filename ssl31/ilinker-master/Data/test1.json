Also  it is not that useful to be required to pass a second parameter to a  parse  function in order to specify the date template from which to parse.  In most cases  I grab my dates from some input field  perhaps a text field .  I generally allow the person to enter the date in whatever format he sees fit.  As such  I just wanna pass a date  no format template  over to a parse function and have it decipher the date if possible and return it as a date object.

I ve even tried date.js and find that it doesn t always successfully parse a date in some format.  Anyway  I know this is a biggie.

In Finnish when you want to refer to future  it s not actually enough to just replace the string of few seconds with muutama sekunti and use a prefix or a suffix  but you actually have to inflect the words to muutaman sekunnin and then add p  st  after them.  The phrase  in few seconds  would translate to  muutaman sekunnin p  st    here both of the words muutama and minuutti are inflected.

I created a new object called Duration that can be  add ed and  subtract ed.  It can be instantiated using the  moment.duration  function.  There are three ways to instantiate a Duration object: Object  key/value  and millisecond.  The following five invocations result in essentially the same Duration object.      javascript moment.duration  seconds: 45  ; moment.duration  s: 45  ; moment.duration 45   seconds  ; moment.duration 45   s  ; moment.duration 45000 ;      I exposed the  Duration.prototype  on  moment.duration.fn .  On it currently there are two methods:  toValue  and  humanize .   toValue  returns the milliseconds of all the options added together.   humanize  contains the functionality that  moment.humanizeDuration  used to contain.  I deprecated  moment.humanizeDuration   but I left it and the tests in place.  It now relies on  Duration.prototype.humanize .   moment.fn.from  also relies on the  Duration.prototype.humanize  now instead of  humanizeDuration .    Things that it doesn t do  yet      There is no  isDuration  function to type check Duration objects.     When  add ing using a duration  it basically clones the duration object by calling  moment.duration  on it.  So  there is no special handling of Durations versus normal Objects in adding and subtracting.     If you create a Duration of 7 days and check the  weeks  property  it will still be zero.    Don t merge this in yet.  I am opening this pull request so that we can continue the conversation and also start developing this feature.  cc @nilakanta ", "user": "rockymeza", "state": "closed", "comments": "10", "created_at": "2012-04-07 16:30:05", "closed_at": "2012-04-23 17:10:52", "assignee": "", "labels": "New Feature", "milestone": "", "PR": "", "type": "1", "null": ["1"]}, {"Id": "13984", "repo": "moment/moment", "issue_id": "266", "title": "Add a getter for moment.lang  ", "body": "@eternicode get a problem to implement in a calendar widget a per instance translations with moment.js.

The problem stems from the timezone offset being added to the hours of the  datePartArray .

To give you an example  we re making somekind of store for plane tickets. The  duration.humanize    function is way to imprecise for us.   For example when leaving at:  12:00 and landing at 13:30. It will round it to 2 hours. But we need some kind of granularity which is missing from momentjs.  humanize could default to 1 level of precision starting from the highest value.       // 1:30 duration.humanize   2 hour duration.humanize  precision: 2   1 hour 30 minutes duration.humanize  precision: 3   1 hour 30 minutes 0 seconds      The second problem is when there is the number 0. Momentjs translates it as  few seconds . I m not so sure how it could be achieved but it would be cool to have some kind of formatting.       // 3 days and 0 minutes duration.format  D [and] M   > 3 days and 0 minutes duration.format  H [and] M   > 72 hours and 0 minutes duration.format  H [and] m   > 72 hours and few minutes      That way the highest value could be mapped in the format.

There are a few different ways to define when the week of year should start. Right now   moment  .format  w    does not have a documented definition of when the week starts.  Here are a few definitions from around the web.    ISO 8601 week number    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date  The first week of a year is the week that contains the first Thursday of the year. The weeks start on Mondays.  strftime token   V  php date format token  W  django date format token  W     First Sunday    The first week of a year is the week that contains the first Sunday of the year.

The weeks start on Mondays.  strftime token   W     Current Moment Method    The first week of a year is the week that contains the first Friday of the year. The weeks start on Sunday.  I definitely think we should change the current functionality to match one of the more common formats  so here are my suggestions.  First  we change  w ww wo  to the   First Sunday   method. This will only have the effect of changing the day of the year that the weeks start on  so this will change the results for 2/7 moments  all Sat and Sun moments . As this is a breaking change  we would have to release this in  2.0.0 .  Second  we add  W WW Wo  for ISO 8601 week dates.  Third  we add a bunch of tests for these formatting tokens and much clearer documentation on what rules we are using when we say  week of year .

However  when working on this I ran into some tricky problems  so I want to outline them here for posterity.  There are a few different ways to calculate the difference in years. The first way is to compare the percentages through the year.      javascript startPercent = 45 / 365; // 0.1232876712328767 endPercent = 57 / 365; // 0.15616438356164383 diffPercent = endPercent   startPercent; // 0.03287671232876713      However  this has unexpected results when crossing leap years due to the extra day. 45 days into the year is a slightly smaller percentage on years with 366 days than years with 365 days.      javascript startPercent = 45 / 365; // 0.1232876712328767 endPercent = 45 / 366; // 0.12295081967213115 diffPercent = endPercent   startPercent; //  0.0003368515607455602      The solution I am proposing is that we use the percentages through the months divided by 12.  We calculate the percentage through the year with month accuracy  0/12  1/12  2/12 ... 11/12 .  We then calculate the percentages through the start and end months with millisecond accuracy. For example   189798626 /  31    24    60    60    1000  .  Then  the combination of those two diffs results in a slightly more expected result.  An added bonus to this methodology is that we can use the same calculation for difference in months. Month diff = year diff    12.

Using it in a Titanium mobile app. Weird logic in the following using  diff :  var today =  Moment  ; var birthDay =  Moment _birthDate ; var diff = today.diff birthDay   years  ;  This calculates the age of someone. Now if the date today is 21 Jan  2013 =  2013 01 21  and one enters a birthday  _birthDate  of tomorrow 22 Jan  2013 =  2013 01 22  it returns the age of 65 which is incorrect because the person is actually still 64. I worked out that this is probably due to integer rounding errors as the age switches between 64 and 65 years old at the 6 month from today boundary.  So I can see you are doing common rounding arithmetic from a float to an integer but this is completely non sensical in terms of dates. Decimal calculation of integer values like years makes no sense. This should obey the common sense understanding of difference when using the appropriate units of date e.g. years  months  weeks etc  Cheers Simon Buckingham simon@icecandy.com ", "user": "icecandy", "state": "closed", "comments": "4", "created_at": "2013-01-21 17:24:04", "closed_at": "2013-02-27 19:19:04", "assignee": "", "labels": "", "milestone": "", "PR": "0", "type": "1"}, {"Id": "13661", "repo": "moment/moment", "issue_id": "589", "title": "Ukrainian translation", "body": "There s some problem with Makefile in develop branch  so I cannot minimize language file ", "user": "zemlanin", "state": "closed", "comments": "0", "created_at": "2013-01-21 20:25:10", "closed_at": "2013-01-21 20:28:15", "assignee": "", "labels": "", "milestone": "", "PR": "1", "type": "1"}, {"Id": "13660", "repo": "moment/moment", "issue_id": "590", "title": "Ukrainian translation  fixed ", "body": "There s some problem with installition of uglify js  so I cannot minimize language file ", "user": "zemlanin", "state": "closed", "comments": "0", "created_at": "2013-01-21 20:57:18", "closed_at": "2013-01-21 20:57:41", "assignee": "", "labels": "", "milestone": "", "PR": "1", "type": "1"}, {"Id": "13659", "repo": "moment/moment", "issue_id": "591", "title": "Ukrainian translation  fixed ", "body": "There s some problem with installition of uglify js  so I cannot minimize language file  And I m sorry for two erroneous pull requests ", "user": "zemlanin", "state": "closed", "comments": "2", "created_at": "2013-01-21 21:02:25", "closed_at": "2013-01-23 18:06:08", "assignee": "", "labels": "", "milestone": "", "PR": "1", "type": "1"}, {"Id": "13658", "repo": "moment/moment", "issue_id": "592", "title": "moment   should not modify the passed argument.

The current implementation of  Moment.isMoment  makes use of the  instanceof  operator which checks a pointer to the actual class  or more correctly function .  This dosen t work if I where to define a new class with the exact same properties and names and this is what happens when  require  fails to reuse the same object the next time you call  require  moment  ; .  When loading a module which in turn loads moment  it won t load the same moment as if you use require directly in your app. So if you use a library which uses  isMoment   it will always return  false  for moments that you yourself creates.  One way to solve it would be to use something like this:      javascript isMoment = function o      return       Object.keys o .length === 4        o.hasOwnProperty  _d          o.hasOwnProperty  _isUTC          o.hasOwnProperty  _a          o.hasOwnProperty  _lang     ;  ;      This test could possible made more stricter by checking the type of each property.

The problem is that in Russian and Ukrainian we have three grammatical genders: masculine  feminine and neuter. And the suffix for ordinals  such as  st    nd or  th in English  depends not only on the number itself but on the related noun  since ordinals are treated as adjectives of the corresponding gender .   So  say  2nd week  2nd month and 2nd day of the month would have three different forms: 2           2nd week   feminine   2          2nd month   masculine   2          2nd of the month  for example  June the 2nd   neuter  since in Russian we say literally  the second number   and even when the month is named  the neuter form is implied .   So when writing a properly formatted ordinals processing in MomentJs we need to know what actually is being passed as a number  not only the number itself. Is that possible at all? If yes  what changes in the core does it need to be done?

This change makes its behavior more consistent.  If you have a moment object with a date around the end of the month and you try to change the month to a month that doesn t have that many days you end up with an unexpected result. You can see this exhibited using moment like this:      >>> var m = moment  20130531    YYYYMMDD  ; >>> m.month  ; 4 >>> m.month 3 ; >>> m.month  ; 4      In JS the  setMonth    method sets the month and then applies the date and rolls over into the next month if the date  e.g. 31  is higher than the last day of the month.  While this is the normal behavior of the JS  Date  object  I would argue that it is the wrong behavior. It causes bugs that users unfamiliar with the oddities of the language won t expect. In addition the date you end up with is somewhat arbitrary and not helpful in any case I can imagine because it s not consistent or predictable without extra logic. If I m using an object and I try to explicitly set the month I want the object to go to that month  not occasionally end up on both a different month AND date from what I expect.  If the month doesn t have enough days it s much less buggy or unexpected for it to consistently go to the last day of the month than to end up on some day toward the start of the month depending on what day of the month it is and what month I m switching to.  In my particular case it caused a bug that could only be observed on certain days of certain months  like today. In my code it creates a new moment object and then tries to set the month based on a value returned from the server. But since the object was created today it causes it to set the month wrong. If I tried the exact same thing yesterday it would have worked fine. At least with this fix it creates consistent and predictable behavior and always sets the month to the one requested.

This is discussed here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16951442/634824  The actual spec is in [ECMAScript 5.1 section 15.9.1.8] http://es5.github.io/ x15.9.1.8   The troubling part is as follows:  > The implementation of ECMAScript should not try to determine whether the exact time was subject to daylight saving time  but just whether daylight saving time would have been in effect if the current daylight saving time algorithm had been used at the time. This avoids complications such as taking into account the years that the locale observed daylight saving time year round. >  > If the host environment provides functionality for determining daylight saving time  the implementation of ECMAScript is free to map the year in question to an equivalent year  same leap year ness and same starting week day for the year  for which the host environment provides daylight saving time information. The only restriction is that all equivalent years should produce the same result.  It ends up that Firefox  Chrome  Safari and Node.js all take the  easy route  and apply the current time zone rules to past dates.  Even if the operating system has more data about past dates  they do not pick it up   Of those tested  only IE is going the route of providing accurate data for past dates  and we all know that Windows time zones are proprietary anyway .  I am really upset with ECMA right now.  This is messed up on so many levels.  That said  there are now many JS libraries I will have to evaluate to see how they are affected by this.  Off hand  do you know of anything with in moment.js that assumes that the local system time has the correct time zone offset?  Just to restate the severity of the issue another way:  Even if the local operating system has a fully consistent and up to date time zone database  regardless of Windows or TZDB zones    most JavaScript runtimes will only ask for the _current rule_ and then apply that to ALL dates.  My gut says that probably momentjs might only be affected for parsing and formatting  but moment timezone might be affected more severely   depending on how little or how much it relies on the host environment instead of the raw tzdb data.

Run it with specifying  for example     useLang=uk cs  and the file would instead only bundle those two languages.

I ll try to go through some of the tickets and point them at this one if they seem relevant.    1. Pacific/Apia is wack    Broken diff test      >> diff   diff between utc and local >> Message: year diff >> Error: year diff >> at Object.exports.diff.diff between utc and local  test/moment/diff.js:173:14       Looks like it s because Dailight Savings [didn t end there in 2010] http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone.html?n=282 . Results in:      > moment [2010] .utc  .format    2009 12 31T11:00:00 00:00  > moment [2011] .utc  .format    2010 12 31T10:00:00 00:00       Maybe use a different year?    2. Half hour offsets break  zones   same / before / after     Not all the offsets are multiples of 60  and that breaks this test. See [Caracas] http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone.html?n=58   though there a bunch. This happens:      >> zones   same / before / after >> Message: two moments with different offsets should be the same hour >> Error: two moments with different offsets should be the same hour >> at Object.exports.zones.same / before / after  test/moment/zones.js:307:14  >> at Object.exports.zones.setUp  test/moment/zones.js:6:9  >> >> zones   same / before / after >> Message: two moments with different offsets should be the same hour >> Error: two moments with different offsets should be the same hour >> at Object.exports.zones.same / before / after  test/moment/zones.js:308:14  >> at Object.exports.zones.setUp  test/moment/zones.js:6:9  >>      This is because we create a moment  clone it and give it a two hour offset  and then check that it s the same hour as the original.  isSame    uses  startOf     which is going to return something different for the half hour offset locale than the full hour one.  It simply isn t true that half hour offset times should have the same hour as full hour offset ones. Maybe the test should use a UTC time as the baseline?    3. DSTs on unfortunate dates    Damascus  and others in EEST?  has DST in [late March or early April] http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone.html?n=487 . Moment builds the array of month parsing regexes by iterating from 0 to 11  and for each i  creating  moment [2000  i]   and checking what the language calls that. But  moment [2000  3]      meaning April 1  2000    actually returns March 31 in Damascus  because it won t be April 1 until 1 AM. So our month parsing array ends up with March in it twice. The result is that is that  moment  April    MMM    isn t valid  Besides being totally wrong  it breaks a zillion tests  several for each language   see  987 . Same with [Amman] http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone.html?n=271 .  Paraguay does [something similar] http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone.html?n=21  around October 1  apparently including in October 1  2000 itself  with similar consequences.    This a really nasty bug    because date parsing really just doesn t work in these places. One possible way to fix this is to use moment [year  month  0]  instead. Though I m not exactly sure why it creates moment objects for this purpose anyway.  Much less problematic  but still bad  the Azores does [wacky stuff] http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone.html?n=271  in March; in particular March 25  2007 doesn t start on time and this test fails in each language:      js var start = moment [2007  1  28] ; //snip test.equal start.from moment [2007  1  28] .add  d: 25    true     25 days          25 days = 25 days  ;      Same with [Beirut] http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone.html?n=34   [Havana] http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone.html?n=99   which impressively also breaks  test.equal moment [2015  2   8] .weekday    3   by having a DST change on exactly that day   and [Scoresbysund] http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone.html?n=705 .  Casablanca has DST on March 3  2011  which breaks this test:      js var m = moment new Date 2011  3  2  3  4  5  6    mCopy = moment m ; //snip test.equal m.isBefore moment new Date 2011  3  3  0  0  0  0     day    true   start of next day  ;      There may be many more similar issues that don t get hit by the tests.

It s two characters  but it requires some explanation  though. First  here s the test:      export TZ=America/Asuncion grunt nodeunit      Which throws out a ton of errors. That s because Paraguay has daylight savings on inconvenient dates. There are a bunch of DST issues from  989 that are really just test artifacts  but these aren t an example of it; this is a real bug in Moment.  Because October 1  2000 isn t a valid date  month parsing breaks completely for that whole month. E.g. October 12  2013 is a perfectly valid date  but  moment  October 12  2013    MMMM DD  YYYY    returns   August   12  2013  or whatever this month it is right now . The culprit is this code from  Language.monthParse   :      js             for  i = 0; i < 12; i                      // make the regex if we don t have it already                 if   this._monthsParse[i]                        mom = moment [2000  i] ;                     regex =  ^    this.months mom          ^    this.monthsShort mom     ;                     this._monthsParse[i] = new RegExp regex.replace  .         i  ;                                   // test the regex                 if  this._monthsParse[i].test monthName                         return i;                                      ...which is building the list of regexes to be used with the  MMM  and  MMMM  parsing tokens. But because  moment [2000  9]   returns September 31  that code pulls out word  September  instead of  October   and thus  /^October ^Oct/  never gets added to the array of regexes. So  october  can t be recognized as part of an input string.  The logic for why Moment does this at all is that for some languages like Dutch  the month abbreviations used in _formatting_ is really a function  and to spare the language from exposing a list of months _and_ a function for providing that month  the code for building the _parser_ just calls that function with a made up date in the right month. So an alternate fix here is to force languages that have a  monthsShort    callback to separately provide a simple array of months.  In practice  it seems to work to just use  moment [2000  i  2]    so I did that. All the tests pass in America/Asuncion  and it didn t seem to negatively affect any other zones.  This also fixes many of the tests for Asia/Damascus  which has the same issue with April 1. That DST also causes other test failures not covered by this fix  but AFAIK  those are just tests assuming that April 1 is a valid date and in April  like  moment [2011  3] .format  MMMM   ==  April  .

I had failed to put a < DOCTYPE html> tag at the top of my HTML file while I was playing around with it and this put IE8 into Quirks mode. IE8 Quirks Mode or IE7 Standards Mode doesn t appear to allow accessing strings as arrays. This resulted in the isPM function always returning false  so 1:00 PM would be parsed as 1:00 AM. Other date parsing worked  so it was hard to detect that this was an issue at first.  Switching to charAt instead of accessing the string as an array resolves this issue  and it fully passes the grunt tests. Adding < DOCTYPE html> also fixes the issue as it pushes IE8 into Standards Mode  but not everyone does this or can use that DOCTYPE for legacy reasons.    IE8 Quirks Mode issue only shows up in the actual IE8 browser. Setting IE10 to IE8 Quirks Mode does not result in the issue  but the WinXP version of IE8 in Quirks Mode does show the issue.

We need a method for formatting durations similar to how we format dates.   It should be as simple as:      javascript moment.duration x .format  H:mm:ss        Note that the formatting tokens would have to carry slightly different meaning  since we re representing an elapsed duration of time  rather than a time of day.  I suggest the following:    hh  would mean  hours remainder after accounting for days     h  would be the single digit form of  hh     HH  would mean  total whole hours     H  would be the single digit form of  HH     HHH  would mean  total hours including decimals    although that can currently be done with  duration.asHours     so this might not be necessary.  Similar formatting would apply for other units.  In this context  the highest unit would be a  day   which would be a standard day consisting of 24 standard hours.  It wouldn t make sense to measure years or months with this due to calendaring issues.

That is   date.max other   should change  date  not return  date  or  other .  Alternatively  the documentation should be clear that  .min  /.max    do not change the called object.

Inputs where the parser has failed but we have a good date anyway  . For example   moment  X.SSS     1234567890.123     which is used in a test  produces the right value and even round trips with  format     but isn t valid. That s because  X  as a parser token eats the decimals and SSS can t match. But the time  including the decimals  worked just fine  and  X.SSS  is the right formatting token to print it.   This stuff doesn t use the code in  isValid   ; when the parser runs out text but still has tokens  it just sets the  _isValid  property to  false   which short circuits the check.    Here s my proposal    which I ll fold into  1098 if there s enough agreement: 1.  isValid    just means  do we have a real date ? No array comparison. 2. A new function   matchesInput    _tries_ to tell you if the input matches the output. Basically  it does the array comparison we re removing from  isValid     but we ll keep track if the input is weird  like  DDD  or months > 12  and skip the array check in those case.  What I m unsure about is whether  matchesInput  should return true or false for those. I guess true  and then  matchesInput    could be called  isDSTShifted    or somesuch instead.  3. When the parser can t match some of the tokens but still produces a date  it short circuits matchesInput   to false  but leaves  isValid    true  unless  strict  is set  in which case it forces them both to false. 4. We can do really ungentle things with moments where  isValid  returns false  like just have  format    return a localized version of  Invalid date   I discovered all this by implementing that  actually   What do you guys think?

Here s a summary of the changes:   Parsing flags  We generate a set of parsing flags when parsing with a format. They are:      js     empty: false                              //did we find anything to parse at all   unusedTokens: [ MM    DD ]     //tokens we didn t use in the parse   unusedInput: [ stuff    stuff ]      //other input not parsed   charsLeftOver: 15                    //formally ._il  the total number of unused input characters. Sum of the strlens for unusedInput   overflowMonthOk: false           //whether or not we consider an overflowed date OK  as in  DDD  parsing   overflow: 3                               //array index of where overflow occurred  i.e. invalidAt      nullInput: false                          //was the input null?   invalidMonth: false                   //month name that didn t exist  moment  splurk    MMMM     userInvalidated: false               //user used moment.invalid   without specifying why        Access with  moment  .parsingFlags   . Note that the flags do   not   include  dstInvalid .   Redefined isValid   isValid    is now a function of three things:   Is  date.valueOf    just  NaN ?   What parsing flags are set?   Are we parsing as strict?  Which parsing flags matter is determined by  strict . This makes it a lot easier to understand and diagnose validity. There are some behavioral changes. In general   isValid    is more lenient. Some examples:   moment  xx xx 2001    DD MM YY    was invalid and now isn t. That s because it parses as Jan 20. I think this is correct. Use strict if you don t want that.   moment  123456790.12    X.SS   was invalid and now isn t.  Open questions:    isValid    completely ignores whether the date parsed corresponds to a time that doesn t exist because of DST. This is a significant change breaking change. Should it check that?   Improved format scoring  As of  1094  we do a much better job of picking a parsing format out of a list by checking how many unparsed characters there are. We can use the parsing flags to improve that: 1. Prefer valid moments to all invalid moments  as measured by  isValid    2. Prefer formats with fewer unused tokens 3. Prefer formats that result in fewer unparsed input characters   Reworked strict parsing  Strict parsing doesn t need its own separate function to check things. We just have  strict  behave differently in these ways: 1. Prepend  ^  to the token regexes. This works because we  slice    the string progressively 2. Place non format characters in the  unsedTokens  parsing flag 3. Make  isValid    consider additional parsing flags    Open stuff:        I need additional tests for that third item.   This is covered by the create   tests   isDSTShifted  We want to know if you asked for 1:30 AM on March 3  assuming you re in the US .  isDSTShifted    answers that. There are a few questions/issues there:   I m not sure how to write tests for it that work across time zones. We could have it skip the test if you re not in a US timezone with DST. Anyway    there are currently no tests for this  .   is  isDSTShifted  the right term for this?  isDSTInvalid   ?  isUnexpectedTime ? Don t know what to call it.   Does it work reliably? It works by assuming that if the date is valid    the  overflowMonthOk  flag is off  that the only reason for  _a  = moment _a .toArray    is that DST messed with the date. I m not 100  sure that s true.   format   for invalid moments   format    always returns  Invalid date  for   m.isValid   . The string can be localized.  Open issues:   Is this what we want to do?     Could use more tests in general   done      Need to test localization   done   Little stuff   moment.invalid    now takes an optional object of parsing flags. So if you re making a third party plugin  you can generate moments with the appropriate flags  even made up ones. If you don t specify flags  it sets the  userInvalidated  flag for you.

The year 0 is considered positive and hence prefixed with a   sign.      javascript /      Tested against momentjs version 2.3.1 and    Chrome 32.0.1659.2   / var negativeDate =   000001 01 01T00:00:00.000Z ; moment negativeDate .format  LLLL  ; //  Thursday  December 31 00 2 4:00 PM  new Date negativeDate ; // Thu Dec 31  2 16:00:00 GMT 0800  PST  moment negativeDate .toJSON   //  00 1 01 01T00:00:00.000Z   new Date negativeDate  .toJSON  ; //   000001 01 01T00:00:00.000Z   var positiveDate =   275760 09 13T00:00:00.000Z ; moment positiveDate .toJSON  ; //  275760 09 13T00:00:00.000Z   new Date positiveDate  .toJSON  ; //   275760 09 13T00:00:00.000Z      ", "user": "terinjokes", "state": "closed", "comments": "4", "created_at": "2013-10-10 22:13:19", "closed_at": "2013-12-20 17:55:33", "assignee": "", "labels": "Bug", "milestone": "", "PR": "", "type": "0", "null": ["1"]}, {"Id": "13071", "repo": "moment/moment", "issue_id": "1179", "title": "Cannot set property  moment  of undefined when library is concatenated with uglifyjs", "body": "I am including moment in an application that runs all the js files through uglifyjs as part of a build process in grunt. when moment is concatenated  I get the above error at this method:  function makeGlobal              undefined  == typeof ender     this.moment = moment ;        I am not using any special settings on uglify  in fact I turned off mangle and made it beautify it for me to see what the function was that was causing the issue. any ideas?

setting time causes it to fast forward 24 hours", "body": "I m trying to time out email messages based on user preferences. My morning calculations are working correctly but it s the evening emails that are never getting sent because dates aren t behaving as expected.  First  here s the code I m using to grab the time and perform adjustments based on user location  etc.          var time = moment  ;     var machineTZ = time.zone  ;     var userTZ = 420;     var diffTZ = userTZ   machineTZ;      var oneHour = moment time .add  minutes   60 ;      var morningRun = moment  .startOf  day  ;     morningRun.hour 7 .minute 0 ;     morningRun.add  minutes   diffTZ ;      var eveningRun = moment  .startOf  day  ;     eveningRun.hour 19 .minute 30 ;     eveningRun.add  minutes   diffTZ ;      I m checking every hour to see if it s time to schedule another email to go out. Right now this is hard coded  but when I begin to add user preferences they ll be able to select their local time they d like things to go out at.  I ve been debugging my values to troubleshoot. Here s output from a job that ran early morning  from the server s perspective : lastRun:    2013 10 12T00:06:55.088Z  this one is being run at 1 am  morningRun: 2013 10 11T14:00:00.000Z eveningRun: 2013 10 12T02:30:00.000Z  The run numbers are as I would expect them to be. In two hours time I want the evening email to go out  7:30pm my time = 2:30am the following day server time .  Looking again an hour later we see: lastRun:    2013 10 12T01:06:58.267Z  this one is at 2 am  morningRun: 2013 10 12T14:00:00.000Z eveningRun: 2013 10 13T02:30:00.000Z <     what?  All of a sudden my calculation for my evening has flipped over the date line  even though it s still 10/12  not 10/13 yet . Because of this my check to see if I should schedule the email fails since it now thinks I need to send the email in 24 hours  not 30 minutes.  Been battling with this weird inconsistency for a while  I thought I had figured out why it was doing it and adjusted my calculations using the time zone stuff above but that didn t do the trick : . This certainly seems like some sort of weird bug as I would expect this to be happening: //Today is 10/12 var eveningRun = moment  .startOf  day  ; //10/12/2013   00:00:00 eveningRun.hour 19 .minute 30 ; //10/12/2013   19:30 eveningRun.add  minutes   diffTZ ; //10/13/2013   2:30 am  This works until at some point it decides that  today  is actually 10/13 and sets the evening run is to take place on 10/14 instead. Help is greatly appreciated  or if this is a bug would love to know what I can do to work around this issue until it s resolved.

You then have the subsequent use of variable  i  being redefined within other functions in moment. This leaves a high opportunity of a bug being introduced accidentally by a developer and even the possibility of bugs in older browsers that do not respect blocks or closures correctly. My suggestion would be to give local global variables a more meaningful name  something that is not just a single character. I would also suggest that within functions  the use of single character variables should be discouraged. Let closure compiler or uglify do the job of minifying.

Currently  moment has a mix of styles going on which can be off putting to possible developers and can make things more difficult to follow.  I would suggest the following as a start:    [1] Variables must not be declared as a single variable but should be descriptive/meaningful in their context.     [2] Strings should be enclosed in either double or single quotes but not mixed throughout  except when minimising the use of escape sequences.  single quotes appear the most common presently  and should probably be the choice      [3] Strict in/equality comparisons must be used  already appears implemented      [4] Equality statements must  where possible  be constructed so that they throw an error rather than assign a value. Thereby reducing the chance of introducing bugs. Ie   Instead of this:  variable === 1  Do this:  1 === variable  Which prevents the possibility of:  variable = 1    [5] Use parenthesis around     and     coercion.   Instead of this:  x = a    b;  Do this:  x = a     b ;    [6] Blank lines improve readability by setting off sections of code that are logically related. Let the minifying process remove whitespace.   instead of this:      function x         var something = 1;     if  1 === something            something = 2;           return something;   function y         var somethingElse = 2;        Do this:      function x         var something = 1;      if  1 === something            something = 2;            return something;    function y         var somethingElse = 2;        These are just some starting suggestions that can be discussed.

However  it would be nice if  moment s had this property.  As far as implementation goes  mine is reasonably flexible. If you want to remove the flexibility in favor of consistency with other methods  I m perfectly fine with that. If one were to use the setter  I would think it could mean two different things: 1. Start of week specified 2. Maintain the day of week and time of day but just adjust the date  I would think you d go with option 2; it seems more consistent with other setters.  I m not sure what out of bounds values should indicate. Say you pass in  7 ... does that mean the 1st week of the next month? Or should an error be thrown?  I m also indifferent on the setter behavior    I ll let the experts agree on a decision  :   ", "user": "OlsonDev", "state": "closed", "comments": "7", "created_at": "2013-10-28 21:19:28", "closed_at": "2016-04-12 07:10:53", "assignee": "", "labels": "todo", "milestone": "", "PR": "", "type": "0", "null": ["1"]}, {"Id": "13017", "repo": "moment/moment", "issue_id": "1233", "title": "Albanian: PD/MD instead of AM/PM", "body": "From http://www.microsoft.com/resources/msdn/goglobal/default.mspx?submitted=041C OS=Windows 207 AM symbol:  PD PM symbol:  MD  Java formats the time also using MD instead of PM.

I m on the jQuery Team  and we re working on a project called Globalize. Globalize has a lot of overlap with Moment.js. One major difference is the source for locales. As far as I can tell  Moment builds on user contributed translations  by now 63 in total. Globalize started by importing locale data from .Net  giving as about 350  cultures   naming is hard... . So far not too interesting.  We re currently in the process of [moving to CLDR] https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/172   using their database of locales as the new base for Globalize. This requires a lot of groundwork to make the data usable in JavaScript. We re also reporting back issues to them  like missing documentation.  I ve had a bit of communication with Tim Wood in the past  see  315  about using CLDR. That was a year ago  since then it looks like the project is now standing on more shoulders  so hopefully adopting CLDR  along with some form of collaboration with the jQuery Team is something worth revisiting.

Moment is great.  But what would make moment the best is if there was a javascript widget akin to the jQueryUI datepicker widget.  Even HTML5 has a input type= date  that will put in a widget for selecting a date.  I m sure moment could come up with something great.  They could also create a knockout binding  so that we could only bind to the widget and have everything taken care of.  I currently use the jQueryUI datepicker widget with a knockout binding like this.   data bind= jqueryui:  datepicker   value: dateofBirth   However  in the jQueryUI widget  it is very hard to select a date years ago  like I am trying to do with my control here of inputing a date of birth.

Calling  zone    again will return  1212. I think for more robust parsing for  zone     either both  parseZone  and  zone  should also accept a format or start parsing from the back as most formats will put it in the end anyway.  Also in a related note  how come a positive number stands for a negative offset and vice versa? If you are using this as a way to get the offset _away_ from UTC  is this an internal implementation that users simply shouldn t be aware of?

The format we use is basically of the expression Qx YYYY/ZZ. We use financial quarters  starting in April  so Jan 2013 would be  Q4 2012/13 .  The basic psuedo code is  assuming Jan = month 1 :   Quarter  initial  Q is retrieved from lang file  e.g.  Q  in English   Ch  in Welsh .   Quarter period x is worked out by looking at the month. 1 3=4  4 6=1  7 9=2  10 12=3  for financial quarterly format  at least .   If quarter period = 4  year = year   1.

These should all be possible by just setting a quarter to start in month 1  4 or 9.  Would this be useful? Where would I start?

JSON.stringify then tries to call the toJSON method. 3. Moment s toJSON method then tries to clone this before converting to utc. Unfortunately this is no longer a moment.  The code for this would look something like this.      var m = new moment  ; var data =  when: m ; ko.postbox.publish  something.happened   data ;      This makes it far less obvious that the moment has been cloned to a plain object.     Expected behaviour  Either moment should support moments that have been cloned incorrectly by other libraries  or a more meaningful exception should be thrown rather than causing a stack overflow.

If you really want that behavior just do  moment new Date  random string that contains date      but  moment  won t be responsible for such convertions. Read below for the rationale about the change     As described in https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1403 issuecomment 31961590  but also recent debugging c4d9f6e and 94d6c90 caused by https://travis ci.org/moment/moment/builds/16672288 brings me to the conclusion that   > using  Date  to create a moment from string  passed from the user is extremely unpredictable  and it turns out to work somewhat and then bite you in an edge case when you re not careful  So I think we need an option to disable it  for tests at the very least. I ve debugged that numerous times thank to our old friend IE6 and friends.  You d pass a string only  hoping that it would hit one of the predefined formats  but instead it hits Date and it sort of works  sometimes. I think it should be clear to users when they re hitting this case  and that it might not work well on all browsers.  The only use case for using Date to parse input is when a  it is entered by a web user  moment s user s user :   and b  the web user can see how we re interpreting the date entered. Every other case is just silently waiting to break at some point.

However  today   Mon Mar 10 2014 10:21:40 GMT 0700  PDT    I noticed that it can sometimes return 9.  I do understand that diff rounds down.

First  here is the issue with the native Date object:      var d = new Date 1383469200 1000 ; d.getMilliseconds  ; // 0 d.getTime  ; // 1383469200000 d.setMilliseconds 0 ; d.getMilliseconds  ; // 0 d.getTime  ; // 1383465600000      Now  here is the same issue in moment js:      m = moment new Date 1383469200 1000  ; m.unix  ; // 1383469200 m.millisecond  ; // 0 m.millisecond 0 ; m.unix   // 1383465600      With this code  I can reproduce this issue only when the browser is in  Pacific Daylight Time  zone  but if I change my browser to other timezones  like  Mountain Daylight Time    the issue does not occur with this same test code.  I imagine the issue will happen on daylight savings time boundaries for whatever timezone the browser is in.   In other words this code is tailored to Pacific Daylight Time.  Interestingly  the issue goes away when using moment timezone and using the exact same timezone as the local browser. Immediately after creating the moment object created above  do this:      m.tz  America/Los_Angeles  ;      And then change the millisecond value  there is no issue.

As a start  all methods will be duplicated with  methodNameMute  variants. We also need immutable variants named  methodNameImmute . From 3.0 the plain old methods will start using the immutable option by default.  What is debatable is:   should  lang  be made immutable   should all the getters/setters  including  get / set   be made immutable too   naming of the mutable and immutable versions of the methods   and of course    should we do the switch  or just stop at the immutable API  The good part is we can make immutable versions of the methods today and decide later on what to do.

In the first one  I replaced the  momentProperties  object with an array of strings  reorganized the clone so that it doesn t sort of do it twice  once in  cloneMoment  and once in  extend    and then I changed the clone to copy the fields over. Results:      >> clone x 220 760 ops/sec  0.65   90 runs sampled       So 6x.

The  _lang  object is defined on the prototype and can be overriden by the instance. Since we don t check  hasOwnPrototype     the reference gets copied on clone either way  i.e. it gets  promoted  from prototype property to instance property . I don t think that has any practical effect unless you redefine the language in the prototype  weird   so I deleted the test  but I could be missing something.

Before version 2.8.0  a duration year was equal to 365 days  and a duration month was equal to 30 days.  Version 2.8.0 changed those relationships to define a duration year as 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes and 12 seconds. A duration month is now 30 days 10 hours 29 minutes and 6 seconds.  From the comments in the code  it appears that the rationale for this change is improving the accuracy of the conversions by defining a year as 365.2425 days  which accounts for leap year rules making 400 years have 146097 days.  The update might make sense if the primary use case for durations involved long timescales in the century range  but I don t think that s the case.  I feel that the primary duration use case is for timescales in the year  month  day  and shorter ranges  and that the change actually hurts the accuracy of the conversion.  There are   many   times when a year is 365 days. There are   many   times when a month is 30 days.  From a human perspective  a year or a month is   never   composed of fractional days. A year can be exactly 365 or 366 days  and a month can be exactly 28  29  30  or 31 days. There is   never   a time when any given year is exactly 365.2425 days or any given month is exactly 30.436875 days.  As an end user  seeing a one month duration output as 30 days was acceptable and easy to understand.

For component it doesn t work  because the locales are not listed as  scripts  in the  component.json   if they would  the require path would be resolved at build time  but there is another issue  because of a dynamic require in moment.js: [line 769] https://github.com/moment/moment/blob/1f22b266c2411d1e06d7e518d5dd866fa40d107d/moment.js L769          There are some solutions to get i18n working in component: 1.   Put all language files into  scripts  of  component.json  and remove the dynamic require  this is acutally what was changed in  1731. But it was rejected  and furthermore it s not a good idea to put all language files into the build output  because you may want to keep the output small and use only one language per page request.   2.   https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/1731 issuecomment 57089309 solution of @anton ryzhov need a manual copy step. And it s like   1.   not dynamic if you want to support multiple languages.   3.     current behaviour:   Only moment is registed as a component script  the locales are just copied as files into the build directory. But you need to expose moment to get the locale working. And this is very ugly  because you need to put this line between embed the build and the locale file.              html    <script src= build/build.js ></script>    <script>      window.moment = require  moment  ; // need to pollute it to window to use some locale    </script>    <script src= build/moment/moment/2.8.3/locale/de.js ></script>        4.   Change in each locale file the require part:        js   else if  typeof exports ===  object           module.exports = factory require  moment   ; // CommonJS: node.js  component  browserify        Because component uses its own namespacing to require remote modules  we need to create an alias in the  moment.js  files. Then we can do  require  moment    for every CommonJS environment: node  component and browserify.      js    function  factory        // create component alias for  moment       require.register  moment   function exports  module    module.exports = require.latest  moment moment    ;      if  typeof define ===  function     define.amd            define [ moment ]  factory ; // AMD       else if  typeof exports ===  object             module.exports = factory require  moment   ; // CommonJS: node  component  browserify       else           factory window.moment ; // Browser global            With this solution you are flexible to include any languages  just one or multiple  per request . And you don t need to expose moment to the window object. We can do this:      html   <script src= build/build.js ></script>   <script src= build/moment/moment/2.8.3/locale/de.js ></script>      or load multiple locals  the last script set the global locale :      html   <script src= build/build.js ></script>   <script src= build/moment/moment/2.8.3/locale/de.js ></script>   <script src= build/moment/moment/2.8.3/locale/ru.js ></script>      And you can still change the global locale via  moment.locale  en    to locales  which are already loaded  in this case  en  is loaded by default  ", "user": "timaschew", "state": "open", "comments": "9", "created_at": "2014-10-07 11:59:12", "closed_at": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "assignee": "", "labels": "Enhancement", "milestone": "", "PR": "", "type": "0", "null": ["1"]}, {"Id": "12282", "repo": "moment/moment", "issue_id": "1967", "title": "Fix catalan ordinals", "body": "As in https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerals_en_catal C3 A0 Ordinals  Is there a way to let the ordinal formatting function know if the moment is formatting week or day?

t a real  issue  in the sense that there was something wrong in moment.js itself. I m posting this here merely because I thought you might find it interesting  and hoping that it might help someone that might be googling for this same thing in the future.  I m using moment.js in my QML app because it enables me to do fun stuff with timestamps  but the QML Javascript engine is not really friendly to the library. There are three issues: 1. The Javascript engine does not support modifying the global object so the exported  moment  variable must be put into a local variable which will then be automatically exposed to callers by the Javascript engine. 2. The Javascript engine does not support IIFEs without some work. The gist I ve linked later in this post shows one way to fix it. 3. The Javascript engine  since Qt 5.2  does not allow the word  as  in identifiers. This means the moment.js function  as  results in a parse error. I fixed this by renaming  as  into  asUnit .  I ve written about this matter on Google  [here] https://plus.google.com/ MikkoAhlroth/posts/c5gnV9kiy1L  and I ve created a [gist] https://gist.github.com/Nicd/6dac64ba3b97c714a65b file moment js diff  which contains the diff between the original and the modified library which works with the QML Javascript engine.  So  it s not an issue with moment.js  but rather a curiosity of the QML Javascript engine. :  Of course I m open to hearing any ideas or if someone has dealt with this in a more elegant way.

Basically  in my use case  I never send invalid dates from server to client.

Generating the parsing flags takes a notable amount of time  so deferring that generation is a significant help.   https://github.com/brianwyantora/moment/commit/928e068349c10d90bceb5266727e016f0cda1259     This change resulted in a reduction of about 60ms on my profile.

Moment  already clones the date  so doing the same in  makeMoment  is just duplicating work unnecessarily.

A simple solution to this problem would be to modularize momentjs so at least for environments like browerify  webpack and such a minimal version can be obtained.  eg.  Regular usage can stay the same       js // get everything under the sun var moment = require  moment  ;      Modular usage could look like this       js // get core  the core does nothing  no validation  no nothing // it would only define a internal storage structure and the bare minimum // methods for getting values out of it: day  month  year  etc  no  format   // functions or  fromNow  since you might not even want to use them  var moment = require  moment/core  ;  // add plugins for all the stuff you need  if you ever want ALL of them you  // just include the directory instead  node/browserify/webpack will pick up // a index.js inside it that would have all the things  moment.plugin [      // if you know this is all the parsers you need this is all you add     require  moment/plugins/parser/yyyy mm dd time        require  moment/plugins/parser/unixtime         require  moment/plugins/validator/yyyy mm dd time        // if we don t use unixtime locally  only on server we dont care for that     // when it comes to validation      require  moment/plugins/fromNow        require  moment/plugins/toUnixTime         // with a modular structure we can add 3rd party stuff really easily     require  moment phpstyle format        require  moment chained functions format    ] ;  // lock in the configuration so that calling plugin method throw and exception // this would be irreversible but you can get a unlocked version by calling copy // this will force people to get a  copy  of the configuration before doing  // anything stupid    or help them find the mistake if they add it later moment.lock  ;  // you now just include this file where you need it module.exports = moment;      Let s pretend the above is in something like  lib/moment  and represents your default boilerplate configuration for it. Obviously you may eventually encounter situations where you need more advanced functions. If we add to the default boilerplate we unfortunately add to every other context that doesn t need it. This is a big bummer if we re trying to keep client size down with things like webpack code splitting.     However    so long as the modular system is capable of being extending any time there s no problem whatsoeve. Ideally  to avoid subtle race condition bugs  we should be able to get a new  advanced  version as a separate instance:      js // load boilerplate we defined previously // we request a copy of the instance so no funny business happens var moment = require  lib/moment  .copy  ;   // we can also create a separate boilerplate if we re use this a lot moment.plugin require  expensive internationalization timezone nonsense   ; moment.lock  ; // lock the new copy just in case its passed around  // moment instances should be able to do a quick copy between instances // to ensure functionality  ie. moment createdAt  could just swap plugin pointers      Now only the module that actually uses that feature pays the cost. If you use moment in 100 places and only 1 actually needs internationalization just that one place will ever pay for it. This applies to all functions  all the core needs to do is store a plain date object and some getters. Is everything you do just pass unix time from the server? you can just have unixtime parser. Do you only ever validate dates on the server? you can skip on any and all validation  etc.   It s effectively as light as you building your own specialized helpers. And much like projects like gulp  postcss and so on the community can contribute easily to it though easily maintainable chunks.

At first I had thought that defining a moment timezone would handle this tidily  but it s not just a fixed offset   days are longer on mars: 24h 37m 22.663s.  The other thing is that typically  Mars missions are recorded in sols  martian solar days  from a fixed date  typically when the mission landed on Mars .  So Sol 1 would be the solar day the mission landed on Mars.  We can call this time  for any specific mission   Mars Mission Time.  Per mission  a UTC time can be provided that corresponds to the start of Sol 1.  I was trying to figure out how I could extend moment to allow UTC  > Mars Solar Time  > Mars Mission Time conversions  and the reverse as well.  Similarly  I d like to be able to use moment.format to format dates in Mars Mission Time but I m afraid it would not handle the extra 37 minutes in the day correctly  would it?   It looks like I might be able to achieve this with a custom timezone but I m not sure how that will handle the longer duration of martian days.  Any pointers you can give me for where to start implementing this would be much appreciated.

Loads of questions are raised from folks logging a moment instance to the console  seeing  _d  and not understanding how to interpret it.  While  ._  convention is common for internal/private fields  it s still not something the common user understands.  Also in the console  the string it displays is implementation dependent.  Most browsers show the local time  but others  like Firefox  show the UTC time.  So a lot of misunderstandings are when the string representation of  _d  doesn t align with the date emitted by  .format   .   Currently  the value of  _d.valueOf    is the same as  moment.valueOf    only when the moment is either local or UTC.  As soon as there is an offset set in  _offset   then the  _d  value no longer represents the same instant in time  but rather the instant shifted by the offset.  Our  valueOf    function  and many others  have to take  _offset  into account and shouldn t.  This is both an efficiency problem  and an easy source of errors.  It also isn t understood when users look at  _d  in isolation  per my first point .   It would make a lot more sense  IMHO  to keep just a timestamp as a number  which is always the UTC based timestamp of the specific instant in time that the moment is about.  Perhaps in  _ts   for timestamp . The  _offset  would be applied to  _ts  for the functions that need it.   We may find we can actually get rid of several functions that use the  Date  object.  For example  I have recently [re implemented functions for date part to timestamp and vice versa in pure JavaScript] https://gist.github.com/mj1856/f6aa5e8b8aa040f65ae1   and they perform _faster_ than native code.  This could be pulled into moment  and other similar functions can probably be written that manipulate the timestamp directly rather than calling functions like  setMonth    on the  Date  object.  This would also have the benefit of not being browser dependent on DST transition adjustment behavior.   I think this will also make it easier for some of the moment timezone integration.

Currently  we rely strictly on the  Date  object  which may not always provide the same behavior.  Specifically  when a local time is invalid  we should advance by the DST bias  2:30 becomes 3:30 .

It s good if moment makes it consistent for Pacific. But then it s not clear why Brazil is still inconsistent if we re trying to compensate.

Let s say you want to create and format a new  moment  instance  only instead of passing a string for the date argument  we simply pass a  Date  instance      javascript let dateObj = new Date  ; let ISOStringFormat =  YYYY MM DD[T]HH:mm:ss.SSS[Z] ;  let invalidValue = moment dateObj  ISOStringFormat ; // invalid date arg  valid format arg invalidValue.constructor //  valid  Moment instance created invalidValue.format  MM YYYY  ; // returns  Invalid date       Another case where this could be an issue is if you pass a correct date argument but a non ISO format argument      javascript let invalidFormat = moment dateObj.toISOString     MM YYYY  ; // valid date arg  invalid  non ISO format arg invalidFormat.constructor //  valid  Moment instance created invalidFormat.format  MM YYYY  ; // returns  Invalid date       Notice how close both of these cases are to a valid  moment  instance      javascript let valid = moment dateObj.toISOString    ISOStringFormat ; valid.format  MM YYYY  ; // returns  01 2016   as expected      It may seem trivial  but the fact that  moment  returns a valid instance when it is created with incorrect arguments  fails silently  and then just simply returns   Invalid date   whenever you try to call any methods on it makes it difficult for one to know where they messed up  especially people  like myself  who haven t used the library very much before.

I ve tried a number of fixes locally  without modifying the plugin source  to resolve the issue because we need to define the locale.  The only way I ve found to resolve this issue is to downgrade to v2.10.6 as this was the last point where  module  was instantiated without issue.

However  it s likely we ll come across this issue again in the future and not be able to just  deal with it   so I was wondering if anyone is aware of a fix for this? If not  are the developers aware of this issue and is there potential to fix this in the next update?

It does have one great feature though  its date formatter  which allows you to do the following:      var someDate = new Date  ; someDate.format   Weekday   d   Month    yyyy   ;      Now  compare that to equivalent Moment code:      var someDate = moment new Date   ; someDate.format  dddd D MMMM  YYYY  ;      Obviously moment s syntax is more concise  and for people who do a lot of date formatting I m sure it s extremely intuitive  much like regular expressions .  However  I d imagine that most developers don t format dates frequently  which means they have to write date formatting strings while simultaneously reading the Moment documentation page.  If they  or a co worker  ever has to revisit that code  they have to return to the documentation page to translate each token one by one.  Now  I would never suggest getting rid of those tokens  just as I wouldn t want to get rid of regular expressions.  But at the same time  whenever possible I do try to avoid regular expressions in favor of more readable alternatives  eg.  indexOf    contains   custom functions  etc. .  Imagine if Moment provided alternative   human friendly   formatting tokens  and one could write:      var someDate = moment new Date   ; someDate.easyFormat   weekday   dayOfMonthZeroPadded   monthUnpadded    fullYear   ;      Even if you ve never heard of Moment  and were somewhere remote without internet access  you could still understand that code _instantly_  and perhaps even be able modify it .  I realize this may seem like a pointless request to someone who uses the Moment tokens on a daily basis  just as it would seem pointless to ask a regular expression expert to write a  contains  method for you   why bother  just use a regex   .  But just as  contains  methods are a lot easier to read  understand  and maintain than regular expressions  an  easy  set of formatting tokens in Moment would be very valuable to many.

I have move the ISO time regular expressions to the Parse/Regex.js file  again for the sake of reuse. Should we also remove the dates from the create/from string.js file for the sake of consistency? 3. I am not sure how you want the parsing flags handled. Right now  they are basically a copy/paste from the create/from string and format.js file  but this is wrong.    What happens if the TimeSet uses a token that was unused by the initial create? Should that token be removed from the unused tokens array  potentially rendering the date valid in strict mode when it previously wasn t?    What happens to the charsLeftOver value? If it previously had a value  it could now be reset to zero  but potentially those chars left over were from the date part of the initial parse not the time  so technically the moment is still invalid . If it was previously zero  it could now be reset to more than zero  this is less bad  a previously valid date has become invalid . I m not sure what the right way to handle this is.

Moment would provide 2 classes that implement the TimeZone interface   LocalTimeZone  and  FixedOffsetTimeZone . Libraries like  moment timezone  could provide their own  TZDBTimeZone  class that implements the TimeZone interface.  Each moment created now has a mandatory time zone. Calls to  moment    would have a  LocalTimeZone  instance  calls to  moment.utc    would have a  FixedOffsetTimeZone  instance  and calls to  moment.tz    would have a  TZDBTimeZone  instance.  To support this  we will no longer be using the local timezone  Date.prototype  getters and setters. All calls to the underlying date object use the  setUTC   and  getUTC   methods  and parsing is done with  Date.UTC   . We will continue to store the  _offset  property on a moment to determine what the offset is.     Public API Additions   moment.withTimeZone timeZone    This is the public api for moment timezone and other libraries to construct a moment in a timezone. It returns a function that can be used just like  moment    or  moment.utc   .      js var create = moment.withTimeZone chicagoTimeZone ; var nowInChicago = create  ; var decemberInChicago = create  2016 d cembre    YYYY MMMM    fr  ;         Private API Removals   moment.updateOffset  hook.  This was build as an undocumented api for use by moment timezone. We are moving the code for manually adjusting the offset into moment  so there is no need for an external library to handle this logic.   moment _useUTC   This is used by the parser to determine whether to use  new Date y  m  d...   or  Date.UTC y  m  d   when constructing the  Date . We are always using  Date.UTC y  m  d    so this is no longer needed.   moment _isUTC   This was used to switch between calls to  Date getMonth  and  Date getUTCMonth   but we are always using  Date getUTCMonth   so this is unneeded.   moment.momentProperties   This added for moment timezone to copy the  _z  property when cloning a moment  but now that timezones are a core concept for moment  a moment timezone moment will behave the same as all other moments.     Public API Deprecations   moment isLocal    moment isUtc    moment isUtcOffset   These methods don t really match the semantics of the new timezone interface. They were added because we had internal flags that toggled between different modes. A better interface would be something like  moment timezone   ===  local  .     Open Questions      This adds  moment.withTimeZone  as partial application for the timezone  should we expand that to format  locale  and strict parsing?      js var create = moment.withDefaults     zone: chicagoTimeZone    locale:  fr     format:  YYYY MMMM     strict: true   ; var novemberInChicago = create  2016 novembre  ; var decemberInChicago = create  2016 d cembre  ;          Should we add a getter/setter for timezones? Should it publicly reference timezones with strings instead of objects?      js moment  .timezone  local  ; moment  .timezone  UTC 1  ; moment  .timezone  America/Los_Angeles  ; moment  .timezone  ; //  local  moment.withTimeZone  America/Los_Angeles  .timezone  ; //  America/Los_Angeles  moment.utc  .timezone  ; //  UTC       To support this  we could provide an api to register callbacks to be used to resolve the timezone string.      js moment.defineTimezone function  input      if  input ===  local         return new LocalTimeZone  ;       ; moment.defineTimezone function  input      if  matchesFixedOffsetFormat input         return new FixedOffsetTimeZone input ;       ; // moment timezone moment.defineTimezone function  input      if  zones[input]        return zones[input];       ;      The timezone resolver would just loop through all the callbacks  returning the first timezone that matched.

Instead  I added a function called calendarFormat that can be used to define what calendar option should be used. This function defaults to what already exists  but can be overridden.

Now that it doesn t have prototype the check needs to be revised  I do === DEFAULT   but that is not ideal   longDateFormat    we add lowercase values to the dict  which might change the default dictionary  because even if its in prototype it is still modifyable   but now we also merge it in  so locales inherit autodefined properties of other locales ... yuk. Its currently fixed by presenting an empty longDateFormat in all locales  if one doesn t exist  so we never modify the base  but it feels fragile   ordinalParse    this is the last problematic one  but I took a decision that you can  fallback to default  in updateLocale by specifying null for some properties.

See https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/8765 for context. The original body of the commit message follows.  These changes do two things. 1. Replace very lax typings like  any[]  with stricter  more correct versions. In particular     the  ISO_8601  constant  while _technically_ a void function  is actually an opaque sentinel    that a consumer should not know anything about it. The function type was replaced with a    sentinel type using the principle of  brands  that can be seen in the Typescript compiler:    https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/413d9a639f933df7539070b236c1677de8302a93/src/compiler/types.ts L9 2. Replace the many overloads of the parsing methods with a smaller representative set that    uses union types instead. Aside from succinctness  this allows callers to provide a union    type as the argument  as long as it matches  which was not possible before  Typescript does    not explode the union type to see if overloads cover all the possibilities .

Environment:    I have tested this difference using node v6.5.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 and as requested the following code:       js console.log   new Date   .toString    console.log  new Date   .toLocaleString    console.log   new Date   .getTimezoneOffset    console.log  navigator.userAgent  console.log moment.version       result in:      Fri Sep 30 2016 11:12:45 GMT 0400  EDT  9/30/2016  11:12:45 AM 240 2.11.0     ", "user": "strokyl", "state": "closed", "comments": "1", "created_at": "2016-09-30 15:36:03", "closed_at": "2016-09-30 15:43:00", "assignee": "", "labels": "", "milestone": "", "PR": "0", "type": "1"}, {"Id": "10772", "repo": "moment/moment", "issue_id": "3478", "title": "Bug in function from  ", "body": "Wrong year number in the result of function   from          var birthdate = moment  26/11/1983    DD/MM/YYYY  ; var today = moment  30/09/2016    DD/MM/YYYY  ; // expected: 32 years var age = birthdate.from today ; // produces: 33 years        Environment:   Chrome 53  Windows 10  Moment.js 2.15.1 UTC  3  S o Paulo   Brazil  ", "user": "cesguerra", "state": "closed", "comments": "1", "created_at": "2016-09-30 19:32:25", "closed_at": "2016-10-02 07:29:53", "assignee": "", "labels": "", "milestone": "", "PR": "0", "type": "1"}, {"Id": "10771", "repo": "moment/moment", "issue_id": "3479", "title": "moment  .isSame produce unexpected result", "body": "  Description of the Issue and Steps to Reproduce:   When comparing 2 different times  eg. 16:00 and 16:05  the result is false.

Non of the above cases trigger the  non ISO deprecation warning   either.   Because of the nature of how the related tests are put together  the newly added test _passes_ even before the fix is applied.  This happens because the  non ISO  tests are tested against the same ISO regex which is being fixed.  Because the broken regex is also used in the test  it allowed the non ISO date to be validated before the fix.       This fix exposed another problem with non ISO dates in the test suite  so it causes 3 other test failures  which are now fixed  too. The other test failures are in:    test/moment/is_same_or_before.js   test/moment/is_same_or_after.js  All concern dates which look like this:     2013 02 01T 05:00  From what I can tell  it is not valid IS0 8601 to include a timezone offset without a time.

Instead of copying  meteor/package.js  into the root directory and publishing from there  the Grunt script should run  meteor publish  from the  meteor/  directory. This commit implements the changes necessary to make that work.  The most important benefit of this change is that the nearly 200MB of  node_modules  in the root  moment  directory will not accidentally be published along with the Meteor package. This behavior is new in 1.4.2  and was an intentional change  but unfortunately it means  momentjs:moment@2.15.2  is very large  and even unusable for some developers.  I work for Meteor Development Group  and this is a popular package in our developer community  so I hope you ll consider merging this pull request quickly.  If you want to test these changes  in particular the reduction in package size   I ve published an identical package called  benjamn:moment   which you can add to any Meteor app:      sh meteor create test app cd test app meteor add benjamn:moment du  chs   which meteor /../packages/benjamn_moment meteor run     ", "user": "benjamn", "state": "closed", "comments": "13", "created_at": "2016-10-27 19:11:47", "closed_at": "2016-11-06 09:15:43", "assignee": "", "labels": "Build/Release", "milestone": "", "PR": "2.16.0", "type": "1", "null": ["1"]}, {"Id": "10711", "repo": "moment/moment", "issue_id": "3539", "title": "Moment timez changes once output to server in another location.", "body": "I ve been working on a travel form for a few months now and I ve had this issue regarding times being sent correctly.

The issue arises when having multiple time zones  those could come from localized calendar components or external services.  When I am only interested in the date  according to the timestamp   I want to neutralize the time  set it to 00:00  in a way that corresponds to the server where I store the data  let s say GMT  and the server stores nothing but the date  like many date database types does   just to intercept the argument with having time zones should solve it  because if there is no time zone only the date is left. So my approach was to do something along the lines of:      var fixTimeZoneOffset = function date        var correctedDate = moment date ; // Overcome the nasty mutability... btw.  what? A mutable date component  really?     correctedDate.hours 0 .minutes 0 ;      var timezoneOffset = moment.parseZone correctedDate .utcOffset  ;     correctedDate.add timezoneOffset   minutes  ;      return correctedDate;  ;      If the date object is in the same time zone as the browser  this works fine:  fixTimeZoneOffset moment  2016 01 13T13:37:00      sweet.  But what happens when I get a date that does not correspond? Let s say the browser is set to GMT 02  either through timezone or just being the settings the browser is run with   and we pass the following:  fixTimeZoneOffset moment  2016 01 13T13:37:00 03:00      then I would expect the hours 0 .minutes 0  part to act relative to GMT 03  not GMT 02  however the resulting time after that step will be:  2016 01 12T19:00:00 03:00  or  2016 01 12T22:00:00Z . When correcting for the offset now the result will end up in  2016 01 12T22:00:00Z  in stead of the expected  2016 01 12T00:00:00Z .  For the love of sanity  could you please change hours  minutes etc. to operate of the time zone of the actual object? It is highly unexpected to have something defined with moment  [...] XX:XX   operate in timezone   YY:YY .    Environment:   Browsers  combined with external data.

I need  expect  moment to return TRUE   i.e. that currentTime isBeteen startTime and endTime and falls in that range.     I thought I had it solved by checking if endTime hour is > 12 then add a day to make moment understand it s the following day.  e.g.         if  startTime.hour   >=12    endTime.hour   <=12          endTime.add 1   days  ;       // handle spanning days         var isBetween = currentTime.isBetween startTime  endTime ;   // TRUE           But if currentTime is also after midnight then it breaks   e.g.    01:30am will not be considered between 06:30pm and 03:30am    also because of different days    Any other suggestions for accomplishing this and simply ignoring the day/date?    I m finding it hard to believe that it s this complex  but maybe it is :           Here s further clarification that issue arises with spanning days  even when trying to be more explicit:        var currentTime= moment  11:00p    HH:mm a  ;      var startTime = moment  06:00p    HH:mm a  ;      var endTime = moment  03:30a    HH:mm a  ;        currentTime.toString  ; // Fri Oct 28 2016 23:00:00 GMT 0400       startTime.toString  ;   //  Fri Oct 28 2016 18:00:00 GMT 0400       endTime.toString  ;    //  Fri Oct 28 2016 03:30:00 GMT 0400         currentTime.isBetween startTime  endTime ;  // false      currentTime.isAfter endTime     currentTime.isBefore startTime ; //false      currentTime.isAfter startTime     currentTime.isBefore endTime ; //false    Seems kind of obvious that they d be false since the  day/date  is considered by moment.  This is what I m trying to get around.    The following would work:        endTime.add 1   days  ;      currentTime.isBetween startTime  endTime ;  // TRUE    This would mean however  that I d need to check if the START TIME was before 12AM    the ENDTIME as after 12AM then add 1 day to ENDTIME.

[REMOVED]  types  of tokens that are searched  implemented : By default  we are searching for   escape years months weeks days hours minutes seconds milliseconds general  .     You can change the tokens with something like        moment.duration.fn.format.defaults.weeks = /custom /;       or like        moment.duration 1234   days  .format  custom weeks     weeks: /custom /              Notes:              The format tokens are not default moment tokens. I need to fix this as per CR  but I m not sure how  since the format tokens all refer to durations.       completed  I ve taken out all references to  trim   and  forceLength  and  trunc  . We can add that into core moment later. The behavior is now slightly different than in the plugin.      completed  I ve added internationalization using  this.localeData  .postformat   similar to other core moment formatting. This should work ok even with the  decimalSeparator  setting.         for your information  This adds about 2.3K to  moment.min.js   I think this is  4.5  . If you need it thinner  let me know.       ok d by @jsmreese  Conversions to months are handled a bit differently  I suppose @jsmreese used 30 days to a month  but it s now something more like 365/12 . So  I adjusted some of the tests to make it pass.    Architecturally  this started a bit different than core moment  and this may need more work and discussion. I m happy to code  but I want to hear from all of you.

Each locale module imports locale information from any 3rd party libraries used along with message translations etc. Activating a locale is done by importing the locale module  using systemjs  at runtime.    An example locale module  fr.ts :       import  IntlLocaleData  from  ../services/intl service ; // my locale data interface  import ng2IntlData from  ng2 intl/locale data/fr ; // locale data for ng2 intl library  import  moment/locale/fr ; // moment s locale data  fr   import messages from  ../../../src/i18n/fr.json ; // my application messages  fr     export default <IntlLocaleData>       // data for ng2 intl      ng2Intl:            locale:  fr FR            data: ng2IntlData              // moment locale name  data is auto defined by importing the moment locale       moment:            locale:  fr               // my messages      messages: messages   ;       The problem I have is with the moment locale automatically calling moment.defineLocale when loaded. When I bundle my locale  using rollup  I make moment an external  I don t want to bundle an instance of moment with each locale  but then the call to defineLocale is problematic. I have worked around this by using rollup s ability to inject code into the generated bundle and creating a fake moment but it s pretty messy.    A big ask I know  but I wonder whether you would consider shipping an alternative version of the locale data which doesn t import moment and just returns the data? Something like this  eg locale data/fr.js :       export default locale moment         return   // same object as is passed to defineLocale          months :  janvier_f vrier_mars_avril_mai_juin_juillet_ao t_septembre_octobre_novembre_d cembre .split  _             monthsShort :  janv._f vr._mars_avr._mai_juin_juil._ao t_sept._oct._nov._d c. .split  _             // etc...       ;   ;         Files like these could be shipped next in a separate folder  eg locale data  next to the current locale folder. To use you would do something like this:       import moment from  moment ;  import localeData from  moment/locale data/fr ;    moment.defineLocale  fr   localeData moment  ;       moment is passed in as a parameter to the locale function to allow access to moment.  The zh cn locale uses moment in calendar.nextWeek/lastWeek.     As I say  it s not a blocker for me  but I think there s merit to the approach?", "user": "timbell", "state": "open", "comments": "1", "created_at": "2016-11-24 12:02:14", "closed_at": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "assignee": "", "labels": "Enhancement", "milestone": "Loading", "PR": "", "type": "", "null": ["0", "1"]}, {"Id": "10626", "repo": "moment/moment", "issue_id": "3624", "title": "en  en US locales", "body": "Just a question:    Why are there no  en    en US  locales?  I understand they have been taken as the  default  value  and so  if that s what you want  you don t need to use locale to start with.

The format should be accepted.   8 Dic. 2016  is parsed correctly  but is not the proper way of expressing a date in this format and the dot should not be required.    I ve lived in Nicaragua for 16 years and the format  8 Dic 2016  is clearly the most common way of writing a shorthand date.  It s also highly preferred to use this type of format because in a mixed national/expat community using numbers only dates is too confusing.    It appears that the problem is related to the fact that in line 19 of   es.js    the test  if  / MMM /.test format      always comes up with an empty value for  format  when parsing.  Therefore  the use of  monthsShortDot  is always used and  monthsShort  is never used.  This is what is breaking the algorithm.  If format was passed correctly  it would select  monthsShort  and work properly.

Since date datatype cannot display dates at the start of the universe I am using Unix timestamps to display astronomical dates. here is a screenshot.  <img width= 1436  alt= screen shot 2016 12 26 at 6 20 07 pm  src= https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11655317/21488079/fb0297ba cb97 11e6 98d5 e996cfd4f7aa.png >  In the screenshot  as you can see  the numbers are huge and I would like to compress them. like 14 000 000 would be 14M and 13 800 000 000 would be 13.8B.

So the moment module used everywhere else doesn t have the new locale.

While in and of itself it is of course a valid behavior i found it confusing  since i expected that diffing on  days level  will basically check for the date only  regardless of actual time passed.    This behavior is illustrated by this code:         console.log  no hours set  ;  var a = moment [2007  0  29] ;  var b = moment [2007  0  28] ;  console.log a.diff b   days   ; // 1    console.log  same hours set  ;  a = moment [2007  0  29  12] ;  b = moment [2007  0  28  12] ;  console.log a.diff b   days   ; // 1    console.log  more than 24h apart  ;  a = moment [2007  0  29  12] ;  b = moment [2007  0  28  10] ;  console.log a.diff b   days   ; // 1    console.log  almost 48h apart  ;  a = moment [2007  0  29  23] ;  b = moment [2007  0  28  1] ;  console.log a.diff b   days   ; // 1    console.log  less than 24h apart  ;  a = moment [2007  0  29  12] ;  b = moment [2007  0  28  14] ;  console.log a.diff b   days   ; // 0 say whaaaat ?             So all works as expected  except when there is less than 24h between compared dates it treats it as if there wasn t any days of difference  even if between two dates midnight passed.  So it isn t all that useful  since if you just want to know if something happened yesterday you still need to write some chain of methods such as:         var now = moment  ;  var orderDate = moment date ;  var daysDiff = now.startOf  day  .diff orderDate   hours  ;           Conclusion    I d like to know if that would be considered as legitimate issue and in such case i d be willing to make PR solving that   provided someone would guide me a little  since i never made any PRs to moment.js  or anything for that matter .

Description of the Issue and Steps to Reproduce:      The [moment js documentation] http://momentjs.com/docs/  repeatedly sings the praises of using strict mode to parse dates:    > Strict parsing is frequently the best parsing option. [Source] http://momentjs.com/docs/ /parsing/string format/     > Strict mode is the recommended mode for parsing dates. You should always use strict mode if your code base will allow it. More than half of the parser issues seen on GitHub and Stack Overflow can be fixed by strict mode. [Source] http://momentjs.com/guides/ /parsing/strict mode/     > While strict mode works better in most situations  forgiving mode can be very useful when the format of the string being passed to moment may vary. [Source] http://momentjs.com/guides/ /parsing/forgiving mode/     > When choosing between strict and forgiving mode  it is important to consider whether it is more important that dates be accurate  or that dates never display as  Invalid Date . [Source] http://momentjs.com/guides/ /parsing/forgiving mode/     The documentation also mentions that   In a later release  the parser will default to using strict mode.  [Source] http://momentjs.com/guides/ /parsing/strict mode/     I wonder whether that change in behavior is still planned  and when it might be planned for. I think it would make this library significantly easier  and less risky  to use.    The documentation does explain what the code does by default   I get that   but I use moment often and just today realized the strict parsing argument existed. Shame on me for not reading all of the docs  and shame on me for assuming that moment would not consider junk dates valid by default. But I do think the library would be more accessible if the API preferred strict parsing. The documentation makes its preference clear.    I did not expect this kind of behavior:     js  var moment = require  moment    moment  2 12231903 234905 1    MM/DD/YYYY  .isValid    => true         Is strict mode as default still a planned change?

Once in a while it returns  false   I guess it s because creating two instances of moment  after each other  with no time defined might create them with a few microseconds difference.    Here s a test I ran in both Node v7.1.0 on Windows 10 and in Chrome/56.0.2924.87 with Moment.js 2.17.1.     javascript  const moment = require  moment  ;    function isSameOrAfter       console.log  isSameOrAfter     for  let i = 0; i < 1000; i         let output = moment  .isSameOrAfter moment   ;    if   output        console.log output  i ;                function isSame       console.log  isSame     for  let i = 0; i < 1000; i         let output = moment  .isSame moment   ;    if   output        console.log output  i ;                function sameExactVariable       console.log  Another test comparing the same exact variable     for  let i = 0; i < 1000; i         const now = moment  ;    let output = now.isSame now ;    if   output        console.log output  i ;                isSameOrAfter  ;  isSame  ;  sameExactVariable  ;       The first two function will log  false  a few times out of 1000  and the third function won t. It only logs when it comes upon an exception.      Environment:    Tue Feb 21 2017 14:36:06 GMT 0100  W.

So I used the  diff    and  duration    functions to calculate the age of person. I wrote some tests with boundry values to test my logic. I wanted to test if I am exactly one day younger than 18 and exactly 18. So I chose two birthdays for testing  today is 27.02.2017 :      exactly 18: 27.02.1999    one day under 18: 28.02.1999        Reproduce       js  // today date is: 27.02.2017    // exactly age 18      var birthday = moment  27.02.1999    DD.MM.YYYY         age = moment.duration moment  .diff birthday  .asYears  ;          console.log age ; // output: 18.00325100985672; expected: == 18    // one day under age 18  var birthday = moment  28.02.1999    DD.MM.YYYY         age = moment.duration moment  .diff birthday  .asYears  ;            console.log age ; // output: 18.00053005036735; expected: < 18         I think the calculation is correct  because of leap years.

Although I ve found a workaround  I still wish to understand the real cause of the issue.     When upgrading ReactJS from v0.14 to v15 in our app  one particular Python BDD browser test had consistently failed on Travis CI  in both Chrome and Firefox   while this very same BDD test passed both locally and directly piped to Sauce Labs.    The assertion was to test a JavaScript functionality by passing a string value in a <input> element and expect it to invoke the onChange event handler. This assertion had no failures on Travis CI prior to the ReactJS v15 upgrade branch.    Eventually I d found that the failing test was related to  moment   well  together with React v15 and Travis CI . The instances of  moment utc_date_string .format  YYYY MMM DD    appeared to be causing JavaScript to fail on Travis CI. Another unique thing about the failing test is that it only happened on pages in which  moment  .format    is used in a loop within the  render    method  similar to the following:       render        return        <div>         items.map item =>            <div> item.status     moment item.timestamp .format  YYYY MMM DD   </div>                 </div>     ;            We ve had the code  similar to the above  in our app all along to display the local time in the UI  and it hasn t been an issue until now with the React v15 upgrade.    Purely for debugging attempts  the following would allow the test to pass on Travis CI:  1. Removed the instances of  moment item.timestamp .format  YYYY MMM DD    in the loop.  2. Added  utc    into  moment item.timestamp .format  YYYY MMM DD     such as  moment item.timestamp .utc  .format  YYYY MMM DD   .  3. Changed  moment item.timestamp .format  YYYY MMM DD    to  JSON.stringify moment item.timestamp   .      The workaround    I found this   stackoverflow   post  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38251763/moment js to convert date string into date  and had tried passing the date string into the  new Date utc_date_string   first and the passed it to  moment     such as the following:       render        return        <div>         items.map item =>            let date = new Date item.timestamp ;          <div> item.status     moment date .format  YYYY MMM DD   </div>                 </div>     ;            Unfortunately  the above attempt alone still didn t allow the BDD test to pass on Travis CI. So eventually  I took the date parsing and formatting out of the loop in the  render    method and put them into a function which returns a JSON object for the  render    method to consume. With that  the BDD test passed on Travis CI.

This lead me to look at the code to see if the types or the docs were right...    isBetween calls isAfter:  this.isAfter from  units      isAfter calls  units = normalizeUnits  isUndefined units  ? units :  millisecond  ;     isUndefined is  input === void 0   normalizeUnits is  typeof units ===  string  ? aliases[units]    aliases[units.toLowerCase  ] : undefined;     The examples pass null instead of undefined  so we get  units = normalizeUnits   null === void 0  ? null :  millisecond  ;  and null is not === to void 0  so we get  normalizeUnits null       typeof null ===  string  ? aliases[units]    aliases[units.toLowerCase  ] : undefined;     typeof null is  object   so we return undefined  which inside isAfter means we fail the next check:       js  if  units ===  millisecond        return this.valueOf   > localInput.valueOf  ;            and instead do:       js  return localInput.valueOf   < this.clone  .startOf units .valueOf  ;         and startOf calls normalizeUnits again:  units = normalizeUnits units   which returns undefined  we fall all the way through the switch statements and if blocks and return  this .    So in the end we don t modify the clone at all  so it all collapses down to:       js  return localInput.valueOf   < this.valueOf  ;         which is the   same   as the milliseconds fast path  except we wasted time cloning. So it seems like passing undefined is   better   than passing null like in the examples.    I think moment wants to fix the typings to allow both null and undefined  and I think the code wants to fix the checks to make passing null have the same fast paths as passing undefined. Today they have the same behavior  but passing null like the docs is slower.

Problem      Workflow issues       Locality  Since moment.d.ts attempts to encapsulate the entire public API of moment in one hit  there is no clear direction to a developer working on a file in one of the  src/  directories that it needs to reflect changes in the code        API surface documentation  The declarations file is great documentation for external javascript and typescript developers consuming the moment libraries. However  there is almost no documentation within the moment code. Function docstrings are few and far between and when provided are minimalist at best.        Mixins  Moment defines only a few core types   Moment    Locale    Duration  etc.  and heavily relies on  an informal mixin like API to provide functionality to the core types. This can be leveraged to improve the tree shaking functionality of moment. However  due to a lack of documentation/types  there are numerous small differences between the way mixins are applied    even between mixins applied to the same core type.    By standardising the mixin interface  it will open up the potential of future work supporting tree shakers  minimising the bundle size of moment.        Dated typings  Due to backwards compatability concerns  a lot of typescript features which would be very useful in the public moment API  most notably  keyof  and  Partial   added in 2.1 .        Solution  Converting the entire project to typescript is a large project and requires providing typings for a lot of internal functionality which does not need it. In addition  it would greatly increase the difficulty of merging fixes back into moment 2.x.        Split moment.d.ts       src/lib/core/core.d.ts   typings for moment mixins  core  and defines the core moment interface.     src/lib/core/units.d.ts   defines the basic units of moment     src/lib/create/create.d.ts      typings for moment factory functions     src/lib/duration/duration.d.ts   durations     src/lib/locale/locale.d.ts   locales  locale mixins       src/lib/locale/units.d.ts   locale mixins for the unit types     src/lib/format/serialization.d.ts   parsing and formatting functionality     src/lib/format/units.d.ts   parsing and formatting tokens for the different units     src/lib/moment/moment.d.ts   The calendar  compare  diff  start end     src/lib/timezone/timezone.d.ts   timezones  timezone mixins.     src/lib/moment.d.ts   Re exports functions from lib/  and        Breaking changes  The namespace is _not_ the default factory function. The following code will be invalid after this change       typescript  // Incorrect: 2.x  const moment = require  moment  ;  let m = moment  ;    // Correct  const  moment  = require  moment  ;  let m = moment  ;         Typings  except for the namespace change  will be backwards compatible  but will require a minimum typescript version of 2.3.

The typescript changes are available for review in PR  4121. it contains no javascript changes so that new types can be discussed and improved before implementation.

Here we apply endOf much like startOf is done  so that startOf does not have to be called in endOf. Then in startOf it also checks for DST failures where some browsers return the previous or next day when they are set to a midnight that does not exist due to the DST jump. This is handled only for those time units which require it to avoid performance issues  but overall the performance impact should be very low as it only does a couple extra comparison in most cases.    The patch is demonstrated in https://jsfiddle.net/1gpr1fys/7/ in case you want to play with it and do your own tests. It logs all  true  in the console if you have the correct timezone  Brazil/Sao Paulo or Brasilia . Works in both Firefox and Chrome.    If you have another timezone that does the DST switch not at midnight  then tests 1 and 4 in the demo fail because they return midnight instead of 1am  that s normal.

Maybe they will be some day  https://github.com/moment/moment rfcs/pull/2   but for now it doesn t look like this will be pushed through soon.    To provide a temporary solution for this  I propose to split the TypeScript definition of a Moment into two interfaces:  MomentReadonly   extending  Object   and  Moment   extending  MomentReadonly  . All pure methods can then be moved to the  MomentReadonly  class. An object with this interface will still be the fully mutable moment  but the functionality will be limited to only pure methods by the compiler.    This is comparable to the  ReadonlyArray<T>  interface  which also provides somewhat of a compile time readonly access to a regular mutable array.

I ve spent half of my working day trying to understand  can we use this library on production and now I see how people are suggesting each other to remove files from node_modules       to not have excess 100KB in their compiled applications. This is ridiculous.

They lack the really useful formats like _date_ and _date with time_ .    Sure you can use _L_ or _l_ to get a date with correct separators  but there is no way to get a date in the natural format for each locale. Some locales might prefer the _L_ versions while others would prefer to have the _l_ version.    As for date and time  we do have _LLL_ yet it is defined as to use the name of the month which is OK and customary for English but not for all languages.    Thus I propose how redefining the localized formats work or extending it for example with Java style short  medium and long date and time formats.    We could for example have:  LDT: Date and time  in a format that is appropriate for most use cases.  English could be same as current _LLL_ and for example Finnish would be:  D.M.YYYY klo H.m.s .    Then for simple solution we could have _LLDT_  long date time   _LMDT_  medium date time  and _LSMD_  short date time . Or slightly more complex  yet much more versatile  solution where date and time could be specified individually with _LLD_  _LMD_ and _LSD_ and for time _LLT_  _LMT_ and _LST_.

This bug was introduced in 2.19.0 with the introduction of the  check for mismatching day of week  if condition. The issue stems from  Date.prototype.getDay    returns the day of week according to local time whereas for a .utc date  config._w.d  would be the day of week according to UTC. For example  since I live somewhere currently with UTC 04:00 offset       js   new Date  2017 10 28T03:59:59Z   .getDay   //  > 5   new Date  2017 10 28T04:00:00Z   .getDay   //  > 6         I was able to write test cases that failed for  me  beforehand and work after my change.

The tokens used to format a moment based on its locale  LT LTS L l LL lll LLL lll LLLL llll  are configured in the source code with a fixed string of sub tokens  independently of the actual moment being formatted.    This is unfortunately insufficient to express how dates and times should be formatted in some locales. The sub tokens to use can vary with the actual date or time being formatted.    Example is French  where the way to pronounce and write day of month depends on the actual day of month. It is an ordinal for 1 and a cardinal for 2 . E.g. correct sub tokens for  LLL  are:      When day of month = 1:  Do MMMM YYYY HH:mm     Otherwise:  D MMMM YYYY HH:mm     Current code has to choose one of the two  for instance second one   and gets the date improperly formatted in about 1/30 cases.    I suggest to introduce new token  LD .  By default  it has the same value as  Do .  Locales can then refine.

It s currently possible to define a locale with a parent that is not yet defined. However  in the case of this bug when attempting to create a moment using a child locale with a parent that hasn t been loaded yet or hasn t been defined causes an exception to be thrown during prepareConfig.    This fix first attempts to load the parent locale during  defineLocale  if it can t be found initially.  If in the case that a moment is created or a locale is set with a child who s parent can t be loaded or hasn t been defined   chooseLocale  returns the global locale instead of null. This mitigates the error described in this bug report in the instance the parentLocale can t be located  and follows the same logic when defining a child can t load a parent. I ve added a test for this case.    As this is an edge case it may not be necessary  but makes for a nicer experience rather than having an unhandled exception thrown. I considered adding a warning in  chooseLocale  but this affected a number of tests.     Also  a warning was previously shown to indicate the parentLocale is missing but was removed  assuming due to the ability to define a parent after a child . However  the documentation specifies that it should still show the warning? I m assuming in this instance the documentation needs updating.

This PR performs that migration. The  JSCS  rules have been replaced by their  closest  equivalent in  ESLint .    When running the new lint task I encountered quite some linting errors  despite the rules being equivalent. I went over the errors one by one  and concluded that ESLint is just much better at parsing and identifying the javascript styling.  JSCS  applied its indentation requirement incorrectly for example  or did not require the same object curly bracket spacing for  import  statements. All the errors have been fixed.
