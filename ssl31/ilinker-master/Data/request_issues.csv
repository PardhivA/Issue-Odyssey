9713,request/request,28,Add body as a property to response?,Hey there   How do you feel about adding  body  as a property to  response ? That would simplify callbacks to be just  function  error  response  .  I ve become a big fan of [Streamline.js] https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs   which lets you write async code as if it was sync  really awesome <3 . It makes the  admittedly not robust  assumption that async callbacks are of the form   error  result    which lets you do stuff like:      try       var result = someAsyncTask foo  bar  _ ;    // the _ is the callback placeholder     // do something with result   catch  error        // do something with error        Which would otherwise be:      someAsyncTask foo  bar  function  error  result        if  error            // do something with error       else           // do something with result         ;      The reason that s awesome is because this totally removes crazy indentation levels and makes code generally so much easier to follow and reason about  especially when it comes to error handling .  But of course  since JS as a language doesn t have a notion of multiple return values  any callback arguments beyond the first two are lost by Streamline. Hence my request. =   In parallel  I m working with the Streamline author to see if we can add a feature that automatically detects and  packs  multiple return values into an array:      var results = someAsyncTask foo  bar  _ ; // if someAsyncTask calls the callback w/ multiple values: var a = results[0]  b = results[1]  c = results[3];      So the pattern for using request would look like:      var result = request.get opts  _ ; var response = result[0]; var body = result[1];      Which is reasonable. But I figure I d ask    would you be open to adding  body  as a property onto the  response  object to _streamline_ this? ;   Thanks in advance  ,aseemk,closed,6,2011-05-05 00:47:11,2011-07-21 18:50:17,,,,0,1
9712,request/request,29,Redirects w/ POST on HTTP 302/303/308: Found,  BACKGROUND    [rfc1945 HTTP 1.0] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945          302 Moved Temporarily     The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URL.    Since the redirection may be altered on occasion  the client should    continue to use the Request URI for future requests.     The URL must be given by the Location field in the response. Unless    it was a HEAD request  the Entity Body of the response should    contain a short note with a hyperlink to the new URI s .     If the 302 status code is received in response to a request using    the POST method  the user agent must not automatically redirect the    request unless it can be confirmed by the user  since this might    change the conditions under which the request was issued.         Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after        receiving a 302 status code  some existing user agents will        erroneously change it into a GET request.        [rfc2616 HTTP 1.1] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616       10.3.3 302 Found     The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.    Since the redirection might be altered on occasion  the client SHOULD    continue to use the Request URI for future requests.  This response    is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache Control or Expires header    field.     The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the    response. Unless the request method was HEAD  the entity of the    response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to    the new URI s .      If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other    than GET or HEAD  the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the    request unless it can be confirmed by the user  since this might    change the conditions under which the request was issued.        Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed       to change the method on the redirected request.  However  most       existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303       response  performing a GET on the Location field value regardless       of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have       been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which       kind of reaction is expected of the client.      So what happened is after the release of HTTP 1.0  prior to the advent of HTTP 1.1 which brought codes  303   and  307  the spec read that the client MUST NOT redirect  POST  verbs temporarily. Unfortunately  there was no mechanism in the spec to redirect  POST  verbs    slight oversight    and the browsers were redirecting solely on the basis of  Location  header. It is not common place for  HTTP 302  to be legacy for the more explicit  HTTP 303 . This functionality should be permitted in Request too.  Both  302   and  303  require user approval. But  because Request won t be able to easily get that I suggest we support a feature to auto approve on behalf of the user.  In essence  if there is a  Location  header the client should reissue the request as a  GET  rather than a  POST . I m going to create an option for this functionality and default it to enabled  per the expected behaviors. I m also going to amend HTTP 308 to redirect with the POST verb  per the explicit word of the HTTP 1.1 spec. ,EvanCarroll,closed,17,2011-05-05 19:53:29,2011-07-21 18:55:58,,,,0,1

9708,request/request,33,SSL fails with Request@1.9.5   Node@0.4.8,I have some code that relies on Request to make SSL requests  and upon upgrading to Node 0.4.8 those calls began to silently fail.  I noticed there was a test ssl.js file in my ./Request/tests directory  doesn t appear to be in git?   I ran it  and that also failed.  I then cloned Request s git repo  @1.9.6  484afc  into my code  and my calls began to work. So  some changes w/ Node 0.4.8 appears to have broken SSL support in Request <= 1.9.5.  Luckily whatever the issue is has been fixed with the unreleased  on npm  1.9.6 code.  I m not sure what the timeframe is to post 1.9.6 to npm  if this is an unintended bug introduced into Node  or if there s anything that can be done about older versions. But  I at least figured I d post an issue to make it known in case someone else runs into a similar problem. ,derek,closed,4,2011-05-25 08:53:23,2011-07-21 18:55:07,,,,0,1
9707,request/request,34,Infinite loop with 303,I recently had a problem where my app is getting into an infinite loop. I am doing a simple get on a page that returns a 303 redirect. Due to some other bug  the redirect redirects to itself. This leads to an infinite loop and error that doesn t go away and will eventually bring the server down    .  We are going to fix the bad redirects  but in the meantime we need a way to guard against this. I don t know anything about the way request handles redirects   is there a way to stop it from following the redirect? Initially I thought it must be an error in our code but going through the loop in the debugger was jumping between the error and a line in request that was doing callback if options.callback was set with error. That callback keeps getting set and I can t stop it   I just want to return when I encounter an issue like this.  Here s the error:  Error: Exceeded maxRedirects.

It should be OK to return an empty response in a 404 even if accept type is application/json. ,benatkin,closed,13,2011-08-01 23:02:02,2011-08-15 04:03:36,,,,0,1

It parses the JSON if the following conditions are met:   the json option is truth   the response content type is  application/json    the response body isn t empty  Both response.body and the body parameter in the callback are set to the parsed JSON. I wasn t sure if I should leave response.body unparsed and only parse the body that s passed to the function. I chose to make them both parsed. The raw JSON can be obtained by setting the request header and body manually instead of using the JSON option.  Another thing to consider is passing on a JSON parse exception to the callback if the JSON doesn t parse  instead of letting the exception be thrown. Should I be doing that? ,benatkin,closed,5,2011-08-02 01:37:01,2011-08-02 04:15:07,,,,1,1

I kept on getting 500s  but it would work when I used curl. After four hours of trying to figure out wtf is wrong  I find out the server is using express.bodyParser and assuming req.body would exist  however the bodyParser middleware only populates body on POST and only if the application/x www form urlencoded content type is set  which curl sets automatically when you POST .   So  this patch sets the content type to be application/x www form urlencoded if the user hasn t already set one. It s not perfect  because it detects if it s set only by the one particular capitalization scheme  but it is consist with the rest of the code in that way. ,brianloveswords,closed,3,2011-08-21 01:53:36,2011-08-25 09:08:58,,,,1,1

Since request does not handle cookies itself  it might make sense to build a generic callback where the caller can play with the headers etc.  Thanks  Julien.  _Mikeal changed the title to add more generic support for cookies._ ,juggy,closed,15,2011-09-27 02:22:34,2012-01-25 00:49:07,,,,0,1

Unfortunately  the increasingly common Post/Redirect/Get  PRG  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get pattern  where a redirect will be returned from a post to avoid the risk of POST duplication doesn t work.    In this case  the redirect should use a GET as usual after the POST has returned the redirect.  Would you consider  perhaps  a flag to override this default behavior? ,rwadkins,closed,1,2011-09-29 20:41:37,2011-10-03 14:26:13,,,,0,1

9654,request/request,87,Error handling with .pipe  ?,I m attempting to refactor some code that currently uses node get:      javascript          new get url  .toDisk dl  function err  file                pool.release obj ;             if  err                    downloads[url].emit  done   err ;                 delete downloads[url];                 return callback err ;                           fs.rename dl  filepath  function err                    downloads[url].emit  done   err  filepath ;                 delete downloads[url];                 return callback err  filepath ;               ;           ;      Into request  and having some trouble. My current  blue sky code  is      javascript         var req_dl = request url .on  error   function err                pool.release obj ;             downloads[url].emit  done   err ;             delete downloads[url];             return callback err ;                    .on  end   function                 pool.release obj ;             fs.rename dl  filepath  function err                    downloads[url].emit  done   err  filepath ;                 delete downloads[url];                 return callback err  filepath ;               ;                    .pipe fs.createWriteStream dl  ;      Which fails  because there is no eventemitter to bind the  .on   s on. It seems like there are two ways to use request: simple chaining with  .pipe    and providing a callback. Earlier I was doing something else: allowing one to stream the file but also catch errors. I don t see an exposed way to both use  .pipe    and grab errors or success from request. Is there one  that just isn t documented or obvious?

9643,request/request,98,Inline port numbers in URLs cause request to spawn multiple callback chains which loop  endlessly ,I ve been using request for a small project where we crawl some pages on a site I work on.  We noticed an issue where request was entering an  endless  loop when attempting to follow a redirect.  Further investigation showed that   request wasn t just looping until it hit options.maxRedirects.  Instead it was looping until it hits options.maxRedirects  _options.maxRedirects   1 times over _   The issue occurs at the point when request fetches http://app.compete.com/login from our server and receives a 301 response redirecting it to https://app.compete.com:443/login     It s this second url  with an inline port which is actually confusing request.  In fact  you don t even need to follow the redirect in order to observe the behavior    you can just try to request https://app.compete.com:443/login directly.  I ve attached some code demonstrating this behavior here:  https://gist.github.com/1316008  I ve also attached a sketch of a patch.  It appeared that by passing the same object around everywhere as options to callbacks that various callbacks were being run multiple times and that multiple chains of processing were running.  Stopping that behavior by copying only the necessary properties into a new Object of properties given to the _http_ or _https_ module caused the problem to cease    even when the same Agent is passed through.  To be honest  I m submitting this in a gist not in a pull request because I don t really have a thorough enough understanding of _why_ this fixes things.  That means I view it as a piece of diagnostic information not a viable fix in its own right. ,rahrens,closed,3,2011-10-26 10:57:34,2012-02-18 04:44:17,,,,0,1

9640,request/request,101,Request does not fire requests in parallel?,I have an app that uses request to grab API data from an internal API.

Here s a test script that shows this behavior:      javascript    /usr/bin/env node var request = require  request        logger = require  ./logger.js        argv = require  optimist  .argv; var numRequests = argv.requests    argv.r      requestsMade = 0      wait = argv.wait    argv.w    0      url = argv.url    argv.u     http://www.google.com       requestApi = function url callback           var requestTime = new Date  .getTime  ;         request                   method:  GET                   uri: url               function err  response  body                   var totalTime =  new Date  .getTime      requestTime;                 callback err  response  body  totalTime ;           ;            doRequest = function            requestsMade  ;         if requestsMade==numRequests  clearInterval requestMaker ;         var thisRequest = requestsMade;         logger.info  Firing Request    thisRequest ;         requestApi url function err  response  body  totalTime               if err                   logger.error  error contacting API    err   trying to request   reqUrl   after    totalTime   ms  ;               else                   logger.info  Api responded to request    thisRequest   after    totalTime   ms  ;                         ;      ; logger.info  Starting Test with     numRequests     Requests.  ; var requestMaker = setInterval doRequest wait ;       logger.js is just a logging tool to print timestamps   set up log levels .

9633,request/request,108,ECONNREFUSED when connecting locally,I ve enjoyed using request on a number of projects  but this problem has me stumped.  When attempting to use request to access a data serving endpoint on my local machine on  say  port 3000  I get a ECONNREFUSED.  Yet if I use a simple function using the http module  it processes normally.  Perhaps there is something wrong with my server code that would deny some header or agent set by this module  but I m just not sure.  I m using Connect  which is pretty standard out of the box... any insight? ,clintandrewhall,closed,3,2011-11-22 15:33:45,2012-02-18 04:42:02,,,,0,1
9632,request/request,109,parseError with certain requests,Haven t had time to really dig in and figure out what s really going on here but I noticed when making certain HEAD requests the httpClient will emit a parseError and there doesn t seem to be anything you can do to stop it from crashing the thread.  Could be a node bug? It s 0.6.2.  It s also possible I have no idea what I m doing and the problem is me.  Changing it to a GET request fixes the issue though.

I don t understand why this is necessary. It introduces a bug since  this.name = str.substr 0  str.indexOf  =   ;  is not assigned a lowercase string. This results in  this.value = this[this.name];  assigning  undefined  in cases where  Set Cookie  for example is  ES=4da3d6b4c946b189 .

I use async.queue  async module  for limit number of onetime running threads to 40 threads. Also I use list of 133 proxy: some of them duplicated  some of them non working at all  but it is doesn t matter. When request ends  it calls callback   which start next task from the queue. When all requests done and queue is empty  drain function is called.  In theory  we should get 1000 callbacks from request   with error  timeout or without  it doesn t matter.

9570,request/request,171,Error Handling for Building HTTP Clients on Request,I ve been giving this a lot of thought lately.   One of my favorite things in  request  is the way it handles requests. If there is a callback  stuff gets put in my callback. If there s no callback  request  returns a stream I can pipe or do whatever I want with.  One of my least favorite parts of  request  as someone that has build multiple HTTP clients on it is exception handling. Handling things in  try catch  when I have specified a callback annoys me a little  but having no predictability when I don t specify a callback is worse.  The way I fixed this in my apis is by introducing the following error handling code  and placing every call to  request  in a  try catch :      js var EventEmitter = require  events  .EventEmitter;  exports= function err error  callback      if typeof error ===  string         error = new Error error ;       if callback        return callback error ;     else       var em = new EventEmitter  ;     process.nextTick function     em.emit  error   error ;   ;     return em;      ;      This way when you are using a HTTP client I made you can be ensured that:   If you specified a callback any error will be returned in the first argument on that callback. No exceptions.   If you didn t specify a callback you can still intercept the error event in the stream you are probably trying to pipe. If you don t attach an error handler to your steam  you will get an  uncaughtException .   It maintains the same important characteristic that if your node application isn t expecting an error and doesn t know how to handle it your process will crash.  I would like to make a case for this to be the default behavior in request. It s a pretty easy fix  replacing  throws  with  err error  callback   and introducing some try catches in places that can potentially throw. Would like to get some feedback from others using request to validate this idea first.  For the sake of the conversation here is how exceptions are handled in request today:      js var request = require  request  ;  // Good Request with a Callback request.get  http://writings.nunojob.com   function err res bod      console.log res.statusCode ; // OK   ;  // Good Request without a Callback var stream = request.get  http://writings.nunojob.com  ; stream.on  response   function res      console.log res.statusCode ; // OK   ;  // Bad Params with a Callback // Throws // Opinion: Should return it in the first arg of the callback. request.get  mailto:duh   function err res bod      console.log  Not here  ; // Never gets here   ;  // Bad Params without a Callback // Throws // Opinion: Should log Not here. var stream = request.get  mailto:duh  ; stream.on  error   function err      console.log  Not here  ; // Never gets here   ;  // Timeout Request with a Callback request.get  http://ithinkimighttimeout.su   function err res bod      console.log err ; // Error here   ;  // Timeout Request without a Callback // Throws // Opinion: Should log the error var stream = request.get  http://ithinkimighttimeout.su  ; stream.on  error   function err      console.log err ; // throws? was expecting this to catch  but ok   ;  // Timeout Request without a callback and error handling // Throws // Opinion: it should throw request.get  http://ithinkimighttimeout.su  ;     ,dscape,closed,26,2012-02-15 13:34:11,2012-04-07 23:48:56,,3.0Blocker,NeedsCode,,,0,1

9556,request/request,185,Make json default,Suggestion 1:  At the moment setting json to true will generate Content Type: application/json header but not Accept: application/json.

If someone wants to send json but retrieve another format they could just override the default with specifically setting the Accept header. I think this is better than being forced to always have to specify Accept header for json even though we already set  json: true .  Suggestion 2:  Could json be made default so we can eliminate the  json: true  line:      request.post url      json: true    body:       foo:  bar          callback ;      This looks more clean and since you often send in json I think it s reasonable for it to be default unless you specify something else:      request.post url      body:       foo:  bar          callback ;      What do you think? ,ghost,closed,3,2012-02-23 01:48:49,2012-02-24 17:57:18,,,,0,1

The app also gets a list of the 5 000 or so document ids in a separate request  asking for 1000 docs at a time.  This part of the app is the part that triggers the silent fail  Request freezes up .  It uses the following service  very similar to the above .      javascript exports.vdsdetectors = function req res next       var to = couch    /vdsdata 2ftracking/_design/vdsml/_view/mainline ;     var query = req.query     if query          to  =  ?    toQuery query      request to .pipe res ;        As I said  the bug seems to have two manifestations.  The most obvious one is the crash  and I have found that it only happens _after_ calling the listing service  but it also only happens from the one at a time service  get a doc or get the doc s attachments .  I _cannot_ get that crash to happen by holding down control r on a stripped down version of my app that just gets one document and its attachments.  The silent fail  in which Request freezes and refuses to work anymore  couchdb is fine  only occurs when triggering the request to get 1000 documents a bunch of times  I hold down control r in ffox .  I can get that one to happen every time  and it will usually fail after working only about 6 times  it varies .  If I hit refresh at a more modest pace  the crash doesn t happen.    In case it is relevant  I am using these services within the connect framework  with a bunch of other things turned on...logging requests  session cookies  etc.  I hope this bug report makes sense  but if it doesn t or if you have any suggestions on what else to try  please let me know. ,jmarca,closed,7,2012-02-28 22:34:35,2012-02-28 22:49:54,,,,0,1

All I m interested in is the ultimate destiation URL  so naturally I need to follow redirects etc. So far so good.  However  I ve noticed this on line 449 of main.js: https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/master/main.js L449   just curious as to why all redirects are changed to GET? I can t quite follow the history of that line but I m guessing it was to follow Post / Redirect / Get style submissions   is that right?  Unfortunately when all you re trying to do is resolve URLs by issuing HEAD requests  this means you end up spidering the entire contents of the target URL   I only discovered this when one such URL turned out to be a huge mp4 file.  I ve noticed setting onResponse to true seems to solve this issue but I can t help wondering what s happening to the rest of the response body   is it aborted if onResponse is true?  I ve temporarily worked around this by simply commenting that line out  as I know I ll always be issuing HEAD requests  but am interested in a more robust and more  correct  solution.

Setting req.useChunkedEncodingByDefault = false; before req.end   does not help either.  Is there a way to reset useChunkedEncodingByDefault for POST requests without patching forever.js? ,AlgoTrader,closed,5,2012-04-20 08:43:41,2012-07-25 18:09:04,,,,0,1

9502,request/request,239,Request method composability,This is really more of a question of intent and clarification. But if you like these ideas  I can work up some PRs  @mikeal you ve talked about building composable apis with javascript and I ve been trying things out with an eye to composability. One thing I tend to do is wrap an existing module to form a new one that re uses the exact same api. It just wraps some methods; to provide some more sophisticated defaults for example.  request  already provides a nice built in mechanism for this with  request.defaults . But here s the scenario I m looking at.  I m creating a request client with some defaults. But I also want to do some munging to the options at request time. Here s an example of maintaining an oauth2 token that might change.      var authToken     _request = request.defaults   /  some defaults  /   ;     myRequest = function opts  callback        if  opts.headers    opts.headers =           opts.headers[ Authorization ] =  Bearer     authToken;      return _request opts  callback ;      mixin myRequest  _request ;  var setAuthToken = function token      authToken = token;    module.exports = myRequest; exports.setAuthToken = setAuthToken;      This is fine for most cases  but there are a few limitations.  It s harder to use the full range of method signatures for request. If the user wants to pass   uri  options  callback    or just   uri  callback    I have to handle that myself so I can manipulate the right options hash. I think the right thing to do here might be to expose the  initParams  method. That way I could interpret the args in the recommended way first. Or I could wrap initParams and implement my request time logic there. That would avoid double calls to initParams.  I m trying to reuse the convenience methods like  post    head   etc with the mixin line above. But this doesn t work the way I intend. Because these reference these always reference the internal  request  function. I can t make them use my wrapped version. Making my own version of these methods would be easy enough  but I would lose the bits of error checking. For instance  head  checks if there is a body and throws if there isn t.  This isn t ideal  but one idea is to have those methods use  this  as the underlying requester. I m positive you hate that idea though. Another idea is to allow  request.defaults  to take a new request function as the optional second parameter. It would require a bit of refactoring.  Here s an example using some of these ideas      var authToken     _request = request.defaults   /  some defaults  /   ;     myRequest = function uri  opts  callback        var params = request.initParams uri  opts  callback ;      opts = params.opts;     if  opts.headers    opts.headers =           opts.headers[ Authorization ] =  Bearer     authToken;      return _request params.uri  params.opts  params.callback ;      mixin myRequest  _request ;  var setAuthToken = function token      authToken = token;    module.exports = myRequest; exports.setAuthToken = setAuthToken;     ,polotek,closed,0,2012-04-22 19:35:01,2012-07-25 18:07:12,,,,0,1

9493,request/request,248,maxRedirects throws error on 301,Have been trying to extract header information from a sequence of redirects using http.get and request using the code below:  USING HTTP.GET  var http = require  http  ;    var options =         host:  t.co         port: 80        path:  /UFUG0GzF       ;  var req = http.get options  function res              console.log res.statusCode ;         console.log res.headers.location ;     var loc = res.headers.location;       var str = loc.split  /  ;       var strpath =  /    str[3];       var opt =           host: str[2]          port:80          path: strpath      ;     http.get opt  function response               console.log res.statusCode ;         console.log res.headers.location ;   ;   ;  OUTPUT  1st redirect Statuscode: 301 location:  http://bit.ly/Hwhiyt  server:  hi   2nd redirect Statuscode: 301 location:  http://www.scoop.it/t/nodejs code/p/1573117519/is node better  server:  nginx   USING REQUEST  var request = require  request  ;  request        uri:  http://t.co/UFUG0GzF            maxRedirects:  2            followRedirect: true              function  error  response  body         if   error       console.log response.statusCode ;     console.log response.headers ;           else      console.log error ;           OUTPUT  Using followRedirect: false Statuscode: 301 location:  http://bit.ly/Hwhiyt  server:  hi   Using maxRedirects:  1    followRedirect: true  default  [Error: Exceeded maxRedirects. Probably stuck in a redirect loop.]  So  if it cannot get a response with Statuscode:200 within the specified number of redirects it throws and error. It s is getting a 301  but that is ignored.  Using maxRedirects:  2   followRedirect: true  default  Statuscode: 200 location: undefined server:  Jetty 7.5.4.v20111024    Redirects on the same host are not considered in the count of maxRedirects  else it should have returned 301 as in http.get above. Note the server in each case. The one using http.get has an nginx server. So there is an internal redirect taking place.  So we can use  request  only to get the first redirect  using followRedirect: false  or the final response. Not sure if the maxRedirects parameter was intended to work this way. ,anandgeorge,closed,1,2012-05-04 04:26:08,2012-07-25 18:05:58,,,,0,1

9488,request/request,253,Inconsistent JSON handling in 2.9.202,Here you say that auto parsing is JSON response is dangerous: https://github.com/mikeal/request/issues/99 so it should not be done. I understand that and can parse response myself when needed.  However  if you issue request with  json  option set to some object  then parsing is still forcibly done for the response  and the  Accept  header is automatically set to  application/json  . Why assume that when I make a request with a JSON body then I certanly expect JSON response and want to auto parse it?  Relevant code:  Lines 643 ... in main.js:      Request.prototype.json = function  val      this.setHeader  content type    application/json     this.setHeader  accept    application/json     this._json = true   if  typeof val ===  boolean         if  typeof this.body ===  object   this.body = JSON.stringify this.body      else       this.body = JSON.stringify val        return this        And line 555 ... in main.js:                if  self._json                try                 response.body = JSON.parse response.body                catch  e                      The culprit is  self._json  which can indicate whether I want JSON parsing  or not  OR the object used for request body. This cannot express case where I want JSON body in the request but not auto parsed response body  or that  Accept  header . The fix would be to separate it into two separate properties? I have no idea about common usage patterns so such fix could cause backwards incompatibility? ,rla,closed,4,2012-05-13 21:48:37,2012-07-25 18:00:46,,,,0,1
9487,request/request,254,No charset in Content Type header when posting JSON,Currently  when you set a json body using the  json  property the following headers are added to your request.        this.setHeader  content type    application/json     this.setHeader  accept    application/json        The content type lacks a charset  which I believe the http rfc says should be treated as ISO 8859 1.  Thoughts on either adding a charset=utf 8 like on the form bodies or opening up some way to set the charset? Happy to do a PR for you  just wanted to know your thoughts on the best approach. ,csainty,closed,2,2012-05-16 12:33:18,2014-08-27 23:49:58,,EasyFix,NeedsCode,,,0,1

9474,request/request,267,Proper way to stream a response,I ve been trying to track down what appears to be a memory leak with some code I have that is making a secondary HTTP request to another host and then streaming the response to the original request.  Is there any functional difference between these snippets?   req and res represent my original request and response variables and callback should be called when the response has finished.      var proxy = request options ;  proxy.on  error   function  err        console.log err ;   ;  proxy.once  response   function  response        response.once  end   function              return callback  ;       ;      res.writeHead response.statusCode  response.headers ;     response.pipe res ;   ;      versus      var proxy = request options ;  proxy.on  error   function  err        console.log err ;   ;  proxy.once  end   function          return callback  ;     proxy.pipe res ;      The proxy response could be rather large  so I want to do a minimal amount of buffer  if any .

Reading the RFC it looks like it _might_ be required to be like that?       _Note that the  encapsulation  boundary  must  occur  at  the             beginning  of  a line  i.e.  following a CRLF  and that that             initial CRLF is considered to be part of  the  encapsulation             boundary  rather  than  part  of  the preceding part.    The             boundary must be followed immediately either by another CRLF             and the header fields for the next part  or by two CRLFs  in             which case there are no header fields for the next part  and             it is therefore assumed to be of Content Type text/plain ._  from [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1341.txt] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1341.txt        I thought I d share this pull request just in case there s something to it. ,ghost,closed,3,2012-06-18 15:55:33,2012-07-25 17:56:22,,,,1,1
9468,request/request,273,Pipe back pressure issue,Currently request doesn t return a boolean from write to indicate whether or not the write was flushed nor does it emit a drain event.  This can result in a large memory overhead when piping large files to request because of back pressure. Consider:      js fs.createReadStream  i_am_large.file  .pipe request.put  http://...  ;      If the above readstream reads faster than request can write we ll end up having most of the file in memory. This patch fixes this issue by adding the  drain  event and returning the boolean from  req.write . ,mafintosh,closed,0,2012-06-25 15:42:53,2012-06-25 17:50:43,,,,1,1

9466,request/request,275,Get request with body does not returns complete response.body,This happened accidentally in a utility function that was able to send GET/PUT/POST  etc based on options passed to it. It took me 2 days of debugging to figure out what was causing it . My utility function was creating following GET request      javascript var opts =                   url:  http://hgilani.iriscouch.com/memento/8be0467d6c3981db55428129934c28c9                   method:  GET                   headers :                        Content Type  :  application/json                                           body:               ;          request opts  function error  response  body                if   error    response.statusCode == 200                    console.log body ;                 done  ;                         ;      In this request opts has   body:        which does not make sense as this is a GET request. But this results in GET request to return body that is of different length  i.e. it gets truncated at the end and JSON is malformed   On doing curl following command fails with error     error : bad_request   reason : Referer header required.          curl   d      http://hgilani.iriscouch.com/memento/8be0467d6c3981db55428129934c28c9      but following command works      curl  X GET  d       http://hgilani.iriscouch.com/memento/8be0467d6c3981db55428129934c28c9      I am not sure if this is a defect in request module or in couchDB or a combination but something worth checking. ,hgilani,closed,1,2012-06-28 09:48:55,2012-07-25 17:54:25,,,,0,1

9462,request/request,279,fix tests with boundary by injecting boundry from header,This is in response to  277. I traced the error and found that it was due to a change that made the request text contain a randomly generated UUID. This made it so that it couldn t be compared with a static piece of text. I added a token to it and made it find the boundary in the header and put the boundary into the text. All tests pass now. More info is in my comments on  277.  I also clarified what happens when Squid isn t installed  so the person running the test knows that all tests that ran passed  that the test was skipped  and that squid needs to be installed to test tunneling. ,benatkin,closed,0,2012-07-05 08:54:48,2012-07-05 22:19:02,,,,1,1

9452,request/request,289,Weird followAllRedirects behavior on POST,With Node 0.8.2 and request 2.9.203  I m getting a weird timeout with POST  or PUT  and the  followAllRedirects  option.  It either hangs indefinitely or eventually registers a timeout.  I can recreate the same functionality by making another GET request in the callback  but the built in functionality should handle it without that.  I m using  request  extensively in my tests and it would be great to have this working again. It worked perfectly in Node 0.6.  The closest thing I can figure out is that it s hanging once it kicks off the call to  stream  internally in the  request  module.  Here s a sample of the way I m using  request :      request.post  http://localhost/sessions       form:       email:  user@example.com       password:  12345         followAllRedirects: true    function err  res  body      console.log body         ,topfunky,closed,17,2012-07-25 00:02:58,2014-08-27 23:48:31,,,,0,1

This patch supports gzip automatically  without overwriting people s headers or breaking code running on older node versions.  It does 3 things: 1. checks if zlib support is present in node  and if so adds it. 2. if zlib is present  and self.headers does not contain an Accept Encoding header  it adds one  with the value set to  gzip  3. after the request body is received  if zlib is present  and the Content Encoding header is present  and if that header s value contains  gzip   gunzip the body. ,mreinstein,closed,33,2012-08-21 00:08:22,2013-03-01 21:01:23,,,,1,1

9435,request/request,306,Nested requests are blocking,I am relatively new to nodejs. I ve been recently pooling all of the collective knowledge i ve gathered through the past couple of months into an project. I believe I ve ran into my first  blocking  issue in nodejs.

The innermost one uses data from the innermost to redirect the user.        request parameters  function error  response  data         //the first request passes a token         request newParamters  function error  response  data             //the second request passes a url           res.redirect data.info.url ;         ;     ;      The error is that when I open this up in many browser tabs it ends up breaking after the first couple then the server says  data.info.url  is undefined.  My question to you is: Should I only be performing one request at a time? I could save the token from the first  request    and redirect the user to the second  request    would this help? I ve been very conscience about async and not blocking and I m shocked that this is happening. Any feedback would be great  ,reggi,closed,8,2012-08-23 13:11:12,2012-08-30 14:48:20,,,,0,1
9434,request/request,307,consuming twitter api using request,I m having a hell of a time trying to figure out what the problem is here.  I m using everyauth to authenticate and grab the necessary access token and secret. I store this information and then consume the twitter api to do the following  get the timeline and post a tweet. I m having no problem with getting the timeline. However  I can t seem to post a tweet. Here is my code:  For getting the timeline  this works :       var oauth =        consumer_key: ss.twitterKey      consumer_secret: ss.twitterSecret      token: req.session.auth.twitter.accessToken      token_secret: req.session.auth.twitter.accessTokenSecret    ;     var url =  http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/home_timeline.json ;   ss.request  url: url  oauth: oauth   function error  response  data        res null  JSON.parse data  ;      ;       For posting a tweet.  this doesn t work          var url =  https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/update.json ;   var test =  status: message ;   ss.request.post  url: url  oauth: oauth  body:  include_entities=true status=thissucks    function error  response  data        res null  data ;      ;      When performing the above  I get:      error : Could not authenticate with OAuth.   request :  /1 /statuses /update.json    This seems odd  because I just performed the get timeline request and it worked. So I m stumped on why twitter is telling me that it couldn t authenticate.  So I tried to see if I could post with json  but that doesn t seem to work.        var url =  https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/update.json ;   ss.request.post  url: url  oauth: oauth  json:  status: message    function error  response  data        res null  data ;      ;       This results in:   Client must provide a  status  parameter with a value.

9399,request/request,342,Cookies are stored and set across domains  security issue ,The cookie jar implementation  apparently taken directly from [LearnBoost/tobi] https://github.com/LearnBoost/tobi/tree/master/lib/cookie ?  only differentiates cookies by path  so cookies are being stored and set across domains.  https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/master/vendor/cookie/jar.js L46 55      js CookieJar.prototype.get = function req     var path = url.parse req.url .pathname       now = new Date       specificity =   ;   return this.cookies.filter function cookie       if  0 == path.indexOf cookie.path     now < cookie.expires          cookie.path.length >  specificity[cookie.name]    0         return specificity[cookie.name] = cookie.path.length;     ;  ;      This is a major security issue  as well as causing all kinds of problems for long running processes that hit multiple domains.  Cookies build up over time and since every cookie is being sent to every domain  requests fail when the cookie size exceeds server limits.  Since [LearnBoost/tobi] https://github.com/LearnBoost/tobi  is a functional testing library  its cookie jar implementation was never intended to be used across multiple domains. The fix here would be to either find a library that handles cookies properly  I haven t found one that s any good yet   write a new cookie jar implementation  or at least fix the current one to respect domains and possibly even limit the number of cookies that can be set per domain as most browsers do.  I d be happy to work on a pull request for this  but I wanted to report it first due to its severity.  Additionally  I found it surprising that cookies were enabled by default for a server side library. Most use cases probably don t need cookies  so it only makes sense that the cookie jar should be disabled by default. Just a thought. ,kainosnoema,closed,2,2012-10-12 18:37:56,2014-02-04 17:43:04,,,,0,1

9383,request/request,358,Piping a request within a request callback causes infinite loop  see attached test gist ,I run into a problem when trying to validate a remote resource with a  HEAD  request before piping that resource to its destination.  The callback for the first request  the  HEAD  request  gets called when the response of the 2nd request   the  GET  request  is piped  which causes an infinite loop.  This gist https://gist.github.com/3991044 illustrates the issue: the expected output from running the program is       HEAD request returned status 200 Received end      ...the actual output  as testet with the latest  2.11.4  is       HEAD request returned status 200 Received end HEAD request returned status 200 Received end HEAD request returned status 200 Received end HEAD request returned status 200 Received end HEAD request returned status 200 Received end HEAD request returned status 200 Received end etc..     ,tifroz,closed,4,2012-11-01 01:41:24,2014-08-27 23:55:44,,,,0,1

9375,request/request,366,Cookie Header Caching,I m attempting to make requests to CouchDB from inside an Express app.  I m seeing a cached cookie header get sent to Couch on every request  regardless of the actual initial request from the client.  For example  I log in to my app on one machine and I see the correct response from CouchDB.  Another user visits the same app on another machine and is instantly recognized as being logged in as me because CouchDB is somehow receiving my session cookie.  If they then choose to force a new login on their machine  then my app now thinks I m logged in as them.  Here s a snippet where I am attempting to pull the cookie from the Express request object and pass it along to CouchDB:      javascript exports.currentUser = function req  res  next      var headers =     cookie = req.cookies.AuthSession  auth = req.get  authorization  ;   if  cookie  headers.Cookie =  AuthSession=    cookie;   if  auth  headers.Authorization = auth;   request  url:  http://127.0.0.1:5984/_session   json:     headers: headers   function error  resp  body        console.log body ;     next  ;  ;      Any thoughts on why this is happening or what I m missing?

Here s the npm ticket: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/2866  I have set up my  .npmrc  file to have settings for our corporate proxy:      proxy = http://user:password@proxy:8080/ https proxy = http://user:password@proxy:8080/      Running any npm command using these settings fails. As a workaround  I had to change the registry to HTTP instead of HTTPS:      registry = http://registry.npmjs.org/      Most things seem to work fine with this  except if I try to install something that has dependencies listed using HTTPS. One example for this is Yeoman  https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman   which lists two dependencies in package.json using HTTPS:      https://nodeload.github.com/cowboy/grunt/tarball/0ba6d4b529 https://nodeload.github.com/yeoman/generators/tarball/282b0b4c51      Downloading these fails miserably with the following error:      npm ERR  fetch failed https://nodeload.github.com/cowboy/grunt/tarball/0ba6d4b529 npm ERR  fetch failed https://nodeload.github.com/yeoman/generators/tarball/282b0b4c51 npm ERR  Error: tunneling socket could not be established  sutatusCode=403 npm ERR      at ClientRequest.onConnect  /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/request/tunnel.js:148:19  npm ERR      at ClientRequest.g  events.js:193:14  npm ERR      at ClientRequest.EventEmitter.emit  events.js:123:20  npm ERR      at Socket.socketOnData  http.js:1393:11  npm ERR      at TCP.onread  net.js:403:27  npm ERR  If you need help  you may report this log at: npm ERR      <http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues> npm ERR  or email it to: npm ERR      <npm @googlegroups.com>  npm ERR  System Darwin 10.8.0 npm ERR  command  node   /usr/local/bin/npm   install   yeoman  npm ERR  cwd /Users/Nils.Winkler npm ERR  node  v v0.8.11 npm ERR  npm  v 1.1.62 npm ERR  code ECONNRESET      It seems like HTTPS does not work through some proxies.

9367,request/request,374,Correct Host header for proxy tunnel CONNECT,As per [RFC 2817] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2817.txt   section _5.2 Requesting a Tunnel with CONNECT_  there is a  Host  header to be set. The examples in the RFC use the same example host/port which is confusing  but logically  it makes no sense to use the same hostname in  CONNECT  statement and in the  Host  header. The  Host  header is meant to be set to the actual host to be proxied/tunelled to  and it looks like at least some of the proxies out there work that way.  I believe this also closes  367.  Notes: 1. it would probably be ideal if the tunnel options were overridable from the main api  e.g. via  opts =   tunnelOptions:   ..      2. it would probably be better if the Host header for the tunnel was set after the logic for resolving the target hostname/port/protocol  which is below the tunnel config code  but it contains a few references to self.tunnel  so I m not sure on that. ,youurayy,closed,0,2012-11-18 20:00:57,2012-11-19 02:05:24,,,,1,1

9364,request/request,377,How does pooling work?,Hello   We have completely disabled pooling in our application  or at least we think we did by passing pool:false  when calling request. Now  however  we re trying to understand how it works because we re seeing an odd behavior.  Basically  we use request to fetch a lot of different files  from different hosts mostly  in our  fetcher . We have set our fetcher so that it does not fetch more than X files at any given time  it will start fetching the next when one is done . We also measure how much time is spend between an item enters our fetcher and exits it  after its being fetched .  We ve noted that when we increase the X number to say 2X  it looks like we re not fetching more items per second. Similarly  we observed that the process time for each item increases. This leads us to think that even though we have set pool to false  request is still throttling our fetcher. Could this be? How can we check that?

9340,request/request,401,Chunked encoding   forever   working?,I ve been looking at request for the last couple of days and am now stuck with it.  I m looking for some pointers with the below issues  and also wanted to confirm that the features I m trying to get working are not broken .  First  if I set headers like so:   headers:      Transfer Encoding :  chunked      I get nothing back  the response callback is never called .  The web service I m trying to talk to only accepts chunked connections  so I have to have it set  without  transfer encoding: chunked  header the service returns an error  Monitor request must be done on a chunked encoding connection.    So  does request handle chunked connections?  If so  are there any special considerations getting it to work?  I can get a  chunked  connection working against the API I m working with using https.request  but the whole point I m looking at request instead is that I d like to keep the TCP connection open and multiplex multiple requests over it  it s the recommended way the web service in question should be accessed .  https.request shuts down the socket right away  and so request s  forever    might solve the problem.  The second question is about forever  .  How do I enable it?  I saw a suggestion [in Google Groups] https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=  topic/nodejs/ZI6WnDgwwV0  to access forever like so:    var request = require  request  .forever  ;   But when I do that  node exits with:   /usr/local/lib/node_modules/request/forever.js:100   options.port = port   Thanks for any insights on this  ,vwal,closed,9,2013-01-01 01:50:40,2014-08-27 23:54:17,,,,0,1

[Semantic Versioning] http://semver.org/  demains that backwards incompatible changes result in a new major version. You might not be currently applying semantic versioning to this project  but I would strongly recommend it.  Alternatively  you could patch the code to continue to accept  user:pass  string as auth parameters. In this case you would only need to increment the minor version to 2.13  to indicate the presence of the new  auth  api. ,christophercurrie,closed,1,2013-01-26 00:23:23,2013-03-01 20:55:08,,,,1,1

9310,request/request,431,Remove bundleDepdendencies from package.json to pull in latest versions of form data and mime  also bump major version.,So I ve been trying to fix a bug with request when using the multi part forms where a form value of empty string will cause the everything to fail.  So one by one I ve been moving from package to package putting all the bits in to fix this.   The bug originated in node combined stream which is required by node form data which is required by request.   Bug in node combined stream: https://github.com/felixge/node combined stream/pull/4  Bug in node form data https://github.com/felixge/node form data/issues/25  And due to an issue with the package.json node form data needed to be updated as well. Now this bug has propagated all the way up to request being the next dependency in line :   The fix to finally resolve this issue is to remove the line:      javascript    bundleDependencies :[ form data   mime ]      And to bump the package version for request up a major version as request will use much newer versions of form data and mime.   If this is done I believe the following bugs in request will be resolved   385  424  And the following issues may be resolved  394  316 ,celer,closed,4,2013-02-10 04:21:37,2013-02-10 18:09:16,,,,1,1

9301,request/request,440,How to know if JSON auto parsing failed?,Currently  request try catches its JSON parsing:  https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/v2.33.1/request.js L879 L883      js           if  self._json                try                 response.body = JSON.parse response.body                catch  e                      As you mention in https://github.com/mikeal/request/issues/99 issuecomment 14016174  this was intentional  and I understand why.  But it has one problem: I as a caller have no way of knowing whether the JSON has been successfully parsed or not. Specifically  if the response is malformed JSON   response.body  remains a string  but if it s valid JSON representing a string   response.body  is also a string.  This isn t just a theoretical problem; I ran into this recently when an API server started returning malformed JSON  with a 200 error code  because it s a streaming API  due to an out of memory error.  What do you suggest? Thanks again for the help    Edited to fix and pin link.  ,aseemk,open,8,2013-02-24 21:22:52,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,NeedsCode,,,0,1

9298,request/request,443,Multiple Requests In Sequence,Maybe this is because I am new to coding with Node.js or with asynchronous oriented programming... but I need some direction or an example as to how to achieve this.  I have some data scraping to do  but first I need my first request to login.  I also have to get the next request to go on to another url to set something in the server to finally get the data I need on the third request.  When I try anything I know or have seen to make this work in series/sequence instead of operating all at once  it just keeps giving me random synchronous results   ending up in errors usually  because it tried to request a page when the login request hadn t yet completed.

9297,request/request,444,protect against double callbacks on error path,In the case that the client callback passed into request throws an error  the request callback may get called twice. Setting request s _callbackCalled flag before invoking the callback protects against this.   See here for some background: https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha/issues/755 https://github.com/mikeal/request/issues/330  Here is a simple mocha testcase that shows one example of this happening. In this case  i m forcing the issue by using a url that request will fail to fetch  and then throwing an error in the callback.       var request = require  request  ;  function testFunction requestOptions  onCompletion         var hasBeenCalled = false;      request requestOptions  function  error            if  hasBeenCalled                console.log  WARNING multiple callback  ;                   hasBeenCalled = true;          throw new Error  whoops  ;          onCompletion error ;       ;    describe  testFunction   function          it  should not invoke the request callback twice   function  done            testFunction  url: http://localhost:6789    done ;       ;   ;     ,spollack,closed,0,2013-02-25 20:11:05,2013-02-25 20:12:56,,,,1,1
9296,request/request,445,Not specifying callback can result in unhandled error,I m using the convenience methods for making a request without specifying a callback. If that request fails for some reason it will throw an unhandled error. I m not really interested in whether the request makes it or not in this particular case  hence the missing callback  but the unhandled error exits my process. Just adding a callback or even doing  request  http://localhost:1/  .on  error   function      ;  works but I would expect the library to handle any errors when using a convenience method. Perhaps this should be noted in the documentation somewhere?  Example code that triggers the error  make sure you re not running anything on port 1  .      javascript var request = require  request  ;  request  http://localhost:1/  ;          events.js:71         throw arguments[1]; // Unhandled  error  event                        ^ Error: connect ECONNREFUSED     at errnoException  net.js:770:11      at Object.afterConnect [as oncomplete]  net.js:761:19      ,bergman,closed,1,2013-02-26 12:39:32,2013-02-26 16:18:21,,,,0,1
9295,request/request,446,Content length issue with form data and streams,Saw a bug similar to this which is now closed  for some reason  but if you think this is a dupe go ahead and close it.  Anyhow  the following:      javascript var upload = request       url:  http://example.com/       method:  POST      function err  resp  body        console.log body ;   ; var form = upload.form  ; form.append  test    somestring  ; form.append  test2    anotherstring  ; form.append  Filedata   fs.createReadStream  1M.data   ; form.getLength function err  len        upload.setHeader  Content Length   len ;   ;      This results in a 411 response from a standard nginx server. Using getLengthSync makes no difference  removing the last 3 lines makes no difference. Also resp.request.headers does contain a content length with a value which seems correct.   So why is it that it still fails? Why do I have to do any of this in the first place? Your examples should work as is  and this is almost a direct copy of your example in the readme  except the last 3 lines and changing request.post   to request   . ,jmzrlz,closed,4,2013-02-26 15:43:58,2013-02-26 16:17:41,,,,0,1

The new auth API changes are not backwards compatible  which I discovered trying to use the current master README against the 2.12 release.

You might not be currently applying semantic versioning to this project  but I would strongly recommend it.  Alternatively  you could patch the code to continue to accept  user:pass  string as auth parameters.

9286,request/request,455,browserify support,While working on tilgovi/chromify last month I ran into an issue where the mime types file couldn t be read by request  because it wasn t included . At the time I hacked around it hard by bundling the mime types file through emscripten and a readFileSync that read from that.  With the  browser  attribute of either request or the mime types module I bet we can preload the data so that it just works.  I ll look into it and come back with a PR over the weekend. ,tilgovi,closed,22,2013-03-02 01:50:53,2014-12-07 15:08:44,,,,0,1

9276,request/request,465,default pooling behavior is fundamentally incompatible with composibility,The current default behavior in request and core s http.request   is just about the most insidious kind of bug riddled behavior possible. Once you have 5 or more extant open connections  any additional outgoing connections will just HANG FOREVER until one of the other connections finally dies. Now the behavior of your program is dependent on what other pieces of code in your program are doing and might hang inexplicably at ANY TIME.  More ranting: https://github.com/substack/hyperquest pooling is evil  @isaacs is fixing most of my objections in node 0.10 but it would be great if we didn t have to wait as long for request to do the right thing here.  Until this issue is fixed I ll ripping out every instance of request in all of my modules to use [hyperquest] https://github.com/substack/hyperquest  because the current behavior of request s horrible connection pooling behavior is fundamentally incompatible with composing behavior from lots of tiny pieces. ,substack,closed,3,2013-03-08 07:28:33,2014-08-28 00:00:08,,,,0,1

Request has traditionally tried to offer a simpler API to the pooling in core and also straddle compatibility between versions of pooling in core.  These issues won t be fixed in core until 0.12  it may be prudent to move request  tunnel agent and forever agent  or possibly deprecate entirely  to the new pooling structure being discussed for 0.12.  As discussed here  https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/4769  something like require  net  .createPool   will go in to 0.12.

9250,request/request,491,Requesting Engadget RSS feed at one second intervals causes request to freeze.,Using setInterval to make requests to Engadget RSS feed  http://www.engadget.com/rss.xml  causes Request to freeze after about 30 minutes of requesting every second.  I took the example from the Readme and modified it to show what is going on:      var request = require  request  ;  function makeRequest         request  http://www.engadget.com/rss.xml   function  error  response  body            console.log  callback getting called  ;       ;    setInterval makeRequest  1000 ;      For about 30 minutes this runs just fine. Every second the callback prints  callback getting called . Then suddenly the printing of new lines just freezes. No new lines are printed. No errors are getting printed as well  in case I change to code to print error variable. In that case null gets printed until the freeze  then nothing. If I make the application to request other url as well  tested with this: http://yle.fi/uutiset/rss/paauutiset.rss  using for example an array and a loop  the other url gets requested just fine.  When the application is in the frozen state  I can use the same computer to refresh the Engadget RSS feed in browser just fine.  Seems that Request does not request the url after a while for some reason or Engadget stops responding because of the one second interval but Request does not handle the timeout. The latter seems unlikely as I can load the url using a browser. ,MattiNieminen,closed,13,2013-03-26 07:44:58,2013-03-26 15:23:30,,,,0,1

9248,request/request,493,Allow not forwarding certain headers,I m using request to pipe a stream between a remote Web host and a file upload API. The API in question uses ETag as an MD5 hash  and when using request to pipe directly to the API endpint  the automatically forwarded Etag causes the API to fail.  One possible solution  I m very open to discussion  is to allow explicitly opting out forwarded headers. That s what I ve implemented here.  You could also do wholesale disallow  except for content length  type  etc  or some other solution  whitelist?   Thoughts?  Sample code:      Javascript request  http://my.server.with.etag.com/foo.jpg  .pipe request       method:  PUT       uri:  http://somewhere.else       forwardedHeaderBlacklist:           etag: true          callback ;     ,kenperkins,closed,5,2013-03-28 23:43:11,2013-03-29 20:41:00,,,,1,1

Authentication token type  GST  is not valid here.   requestId : 6XYP7FPIGR   status :401  timestamp :1364501128399    The fix: set request.jar to false.

9226,request/request,515,Port 80 is included in the  Host  request field  instead of defaulted  when it isn t with other popular HTTP clients,Hi   So we encountered an interesting problem today  less so a bug with request but more of a incongruent behavior from request when compared against other browsers and client s we ve tested.   When working with cloudfoundry.com we found that their proxy did not consider a request to port 80 the same if the port was explicitly specified in the  Host  header field.  So a request to http://foo.cloudfoundry.com:80/ and http://foo.cloudfoundry.com/ behaved differently. We narrowed it down to the difference in the Host field. Request included the port when explicitly specifying it  but not when it wasn t.    http://foo.cloudfoundry.com:80/ has a Host header of  Host: foo.cloudfoundry.com:80    http://foo.cloudfoundry.com/ has a Host header of  Host: foo.cloudfoundry.com   No big deal right? Well so everyone else strips port 80 because it is the default :    Curl strips port 80 from the Host header   wget strips port 80 from the Host header   Safari strips port 80 from the Host header   Firefox strips port 80 from the Host header   Chrome strips port 80 from the Host header  You can test the behavior using  http://helloworld ng.cloudify.com:80/  and  http://helloworld ng.cloudify.com/    notice that both URLs work the same in all of the above listed browsers  In curl we can see the failure case      shell pair@foo: pair/  curl http://helloworld ng.cloudfoundry.com:80/  H  Host: helloworld ng.cloudfoundry.com:80  <html> <head><title>404 Not Found</title></head> <body bgcolor= white > <center><h1>404 Not Found</h1></center> <hr><center>nginx</center> </body> </html> pair@foo: pair/  curl http://helloworld ng.cloudfoundry.com:80/  H  Host: helloworld ng.cloudfoundry.com  Hello from Cloud Foundry      Now let s try it with request      javascript  request=require  request  ;  request.get  http://helloworld ng.cloudfoundry.com:80/  function err req body     console.log  this will fail with port 80  body ;   ;  request.get  http://helloworld ng.cloudfoundry.com/  function err req body     console.log  this will not fail without port 80  body ;   ;        We ve asked cloudfoundry to fix this issue  but to be clear this is incongruent with every other client and browser we ve tested    So then the question becomes   should request do the same? Sadly it seems like this shouldn t be an issue but it is an unexpected behavior and no one else does it   hence why I think request should strip port 80 from the Header field if it is specified.   On that note node http proxy suffers form the same problem and a nice bit of logic that it uses some places to address it:      javascript   var host=host  port 80===0?  : :  port      ,celer,closed,5,2013-04-15 21:54:42,2014-08-28 00:10:30,,,,0,1

9202,request/request,539,Best practices for conditional gzip/deflate support,I m curious about the best way to decode requests returned with gzip or deflate content encoding.  Using stream piping seems like the most elegant way when you re sure a response will be gzip encoded  see http://stackoverflow.com/a/14739453/566197 . However  that will fail if the response isn t encoded  as sometimes happens with custom 5xx error messages  etc . I m looking for the best way to support conditional decoding based on the server s Content Encoding header.   Here s an example of this behavior with Node s built in http module: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10207762/how to use request or http module to read gzip page into a string. I tried something similar but it didn t work: https://gist.github.com/nickfishman/5499713. My guess is stream piping doesn t work if you use the  request options  function err  res  body    ...     constructor.  Here s the solution I ended up with: https://gist.github.com/nickfishman/5499763. Is there a better way to do to this? Additionally  would it be possible to add gzip/deflate support directly into your library? ,nickfishman,closed,24,2013-05-02 02:22:50,2014-08-28 00:08:53,,,,0,1

9175,request/request,566,agentOptions not applied in all cases,Hi   I m having the same HTTPS certificate encryption trouble experienced by @umutm in https://github.com/mikeal/request/issues/530 and @cybo42 ni https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5360. To solve my troubles  I need to specify certain encryption related agentOptions fields when using the request lib. However  I believe that the request lib does not always apply agentOptions.  Here is the repro case:      javascript var agentOptions =           secureOptions: require  constants  .SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_2          ciphers:  ECDHE RSA AES256 SHA:AES256 SHA:RC4 SHA:RC4:HIGH: MD5: aNULL: EDH: AESGCM           honorCipherOrder: true  ; require  request    https://admin.pearsonopenclass.com/service/status     agentOptions: agentOptions    function      console.log  this is the callback. response:    this.response    this.response.body ;         I can get the request to go through by manually creating an agent using the same agentOptions:      javascript var agentOptions =           secureOptions: require  constants  .SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_2          ciphers:  ECDHE RSA AES256 SHA:AES256 SHA:RC4 SHA:RC4:HIGH: MD5: aNULL: EDH: AESGCM           honorCipherOrder: true  ; var https = require  https  ; agent = new https.Agent agentOptions ; require  request    https://admin.pearsonopenclass.com/service/status     agent: agent    function      console.log  this is the callback. response:    this.response    this.response.body ;   ;      The actual response is not important  only that a response is received in the second case and not in the first case.  I narrowed down the problem in the source code to this line: https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/master/index.js L556  I inserted a logging statement at that line and verified that the agentOptions are being ignored in my repro case. I m not terribly familiar with the inner workings of the requestLib  but I think if the poolKey generation was modified to include details of the agentOptions that would fix my particular problem. Would that be an issue for other users?  Thanks Sam ,SamPlacette,closed,6,2013-06-03 15:36:03,2014-08-28 00:17:18,,,,0,1

It currently lives in https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/request caching which is a fork of @kevinswiber  s repo with some additions.  I recently discovered the now obsolete  20 PR by @mwhooke which essentially does the same thing.   Some stuff  20 does that my code doesn t do:   Delete old stuff from the cache   Caches more properties from the response  I only do headers and body .   More through  Cache Control  handling  Some stuff my code does that  20 doesn t do:   Supports caching of private responses   Default cache implementations for Redis and in memory LRU  without declaring runtime dependencies in package.json   My first plan is to incorporate the work by @mwhooker in my request caching repo  aslakhellesoy/request caching 1  to add the stuff I m missing.  If there is interest I might work on a PR to incorporate all of this into request itself  aslakhellesoy/request caching 2 .

Also Is there a method to clear state at all? ie  request.clear    or something?   cheers ,n99,closed,6,2013-07-10 20:40:27,2014-08-28 00:14:57,,,,0,1

With followRedirect:true and jar:false  request manages to get to the redirection  but keep the content length=0 header  whereas the server response doesn t include a content length .

9135,request/request,606,Convenience option to return error on 4xx/5xx status codes?,I often want to treat a 4xx or 5xx response code from an API as an error case  so I often end up having to check that manually.

Kenneth Reitz s requests library  for Python  has a convenience  raise_for_status  API like this  though it s a method there :  http://docs.python requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/ response status codes  The default would/should be to maintain the current behavior of _not_ erroring on 4xx/5xx status.  If you re open to it  the implementation is simple; the only question is what name it should have. =   Some ideas are  errorByStatus    expectSuccess    inspectStatus   but I m sure others can come up with better ideas   Thanks again for the great library.

9130,request/request,611,Support for  Expect: 100 continue ,You probably already know what this is  but if not  a client can send an  Expect: 100 continue  request header  giving the server a chance to respond either with  100 Continue  or a different  final status code  before the client sends along the request body.  http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616 sec8.html  E.g. Amazon S3 recommends using this:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTRedirect.html  Node supports this perfectly in core    if it sees an  Expect: 100 continue  client request header  it ll send the headers right away  and emit a  continue  event if/when the server responds with  100 Continue .  http://nodejs.org/api/http.html http_event_continue  If the server responds with something else  e.g. a redirect or an error  that s a regular  response  event. And for robustness  the caller should also set a timeout to go ahead send the request body if the server doesn t respond.  > Usually  when sending  Expect: 100 continue   you should both set a timeout and listen for the  continue  event.  Conceptually  supporting this is straightforward: if the request headers include  Expect: 100 continue   don t write the request body right away  and instead set this listener and timeout.      js var written = false;  function writeBody       if  written    return;     written = true;   // write body here    req.on  continue   writeBody ; setTimeout writeBody  500 ;      But I know it might be trickier in practice with the details. =   Hope this helps either way  and thanks for the consideration  ,aseemk,open,2,2013-07-31 01:17:08,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,NeedsCode,,,0,1

9125,request/request,616,Use www authenticate to parse www authenticate headers and generate auth...,I am offering a more complete implementation of RFC 2617 digest authentication  through inclusion of the www authenticate module I recently posted.  This proposed patch delegates parsing of the www authenticate header   interpretation of its challenge and generation of the authorization header to the www authenticate module.  Please note that I had to change the expected response in one of the tests in order to pass the basic and digest authentication tests.  The principal reason is that the nonce count is that  consistent with the rfc  nonce count represented as a 8  digit  hex number  00000001  rather than simply 1.  Since nc is included in the request digest calculation  its representation is significant and results in a different digest.  The order of the attributes is also slightly different and the algorithm is included.  Next step  assuming you accept this request  and essential to applying request to my application  is to generate authorization headers for any number of additional requests  much as cookies are retained and applied to a series of requests.  A single 401 can then provide the challenge for authenticating multiple successive requests.  Thanks for you work on request. Hopefully this addition will enhance its value. ,randymized,closed,1,2013-08-05 01:07:18,2014-08-27 23:41:56,nylen,,,1,1

9122,request/request,619,decouple things a bit,I was trying to make request  [browserifyable] https://github.com/substack/node browserify   again  and I thought to myself it would be easier if I just used what I needed and took out everything else  which also probably causes problems in the  browserification . So I m going to try to make a request fork that is more minimal and extendable  just like the ecosystem of leveldb modules that go on extending levelup.  I m not going to make a pull request of this fork I m making because it breaks  request   but this is a checkpoint along that way  which I thought would be cool for request as well. It just decouples things a tiny bit  by putting components found in  index.js  in other files. It does not change the API and the tests are passing. ,joaojeronimo,closed,8,2013-08-07 13:05:00,2013-08-07 16:47:15,,,,1,1
9121,request/request,620,Need proxy_exclude option,Hello  our company network has a proxy server. We host some resources internally  which should not be accessed via the proxy server. And we need to access some resources externally via a proxy server.  In a normal UNIX like environment there is an environment variable called no_proxy that contains a comma separated list of hosts that should not need to use the proxy variables.  It seems that request does not have a no_proxy configuration option to match it s proxy configuration.  I don t know if I can provide a patch for this feature but I can write a test for it  and I can help test code if someone would help me implement this feature. ,newz2000,closed,3,2013-08-08 14:54:06,2014-10-01 16:32:57,,FeatureRequest,NeedsCode,,,0,1

9118,request/request,623,fix error listener leak on connection object,This should fix  622  When  onRequest  was called multiply times this line would be executed:      javascript if  response.connection.listeners  error  .indexOf self._parserErrorHandler  ===  1      response.connection.once  error   self._parserErrorHandler         however because the  EventEmitter.once fn   method don t add  fn  directly to the internal  ._events  object but rather a function there executes  fn  and calls  EventEmitter.removeListener   see: [node/events.js] https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/events.js L185 191   the  this._parserErrorHandler  method would never be in the  listeners  error    array.

Alternativ fixes are to use the  .on  method  or check the internal  .listener  property on each item in the  listeners  error    array.    I m not intiment with  request  so I couldn t figure out why  onRequest  was called multiply times  I guess it s caused by redirects  and therefore there are no added test   ,AndreasMadsen,closed,7,2013-08-12 11:26:11,2014-08-27 23:41:52,,,,1,1

9106,request/request,635,Add ability to receive a 401 challenge once and then authorize any number of requests based upon that challenge,As currently implemented  every request sent by request for a resource protected by digest protected by HTTP digest authentication would require a new 401 response.  This pull request adds a digestAuth option  which works much the same way as the jar option allows maintaining cookies between requests  except that the object provided to the digestAuth option would maintain a 401 challenge from one request to the next.  The digestAuth option should reference an object that implements an interface consisting of the following two functions: 1. get_challenge response   which will be invoked whenever a 401 response is received.  It should parse the challenge posed by the WWW Authenticate header and save that challenge for later authorization requests. 2. authentication_string method path   which returns either a false value or a string to be placed in an Authorization header.  If no challenge has been received  it will return a false value.  This function may be called multiple times in order to authorize multiple requests.  A suitable digestAuth object is produced by the [www authenticate module] https://github.com/randymized/www authenticate   such as in the the following usage example:      javascript var request = require  request  ; var www_authenticate = require  www authenticate  ; var digestAuth= www_authenticate.authenticator username password ; request  method: GET  uri: /something  digestAuth:digestAuth  ; request  method: GET  uri: /something/else  digestAuth:digestAuth  ;     ,randymized,closed,9,2013-08-20 19:48:58,2014-08-27 23:41:42,nylen,,,1,1

9100,request/request,641,Request destroys existing socket timeout,https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/master/request.js L594 L605  Request uses  req.setTimeout   which calls  socket.setTimeout   as a fail safe to abort requests. Unfortunately  this conflicts with our calling socket.setTimeout in our agentClass  ForeverAgent fork  in multiple ways. 1. New socket        When a new socket is created  req.setTimeout is called  but since it doesn t have a socket  it calls the following [code] https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/_http_outgoing.js L99 L101 :       javascript     this.once  socket   function socket          socket.setTimeout msecs ;       ;          Subsequently  timeouts set in the agentClass are overwritten:          ForeverAgent.prototype.createConnection = function       var self = this   var socket = net.createConnection.apply this  arguments     socket.on  connect   function foo        var name = socket.remoteAddress    :    socket.remotePort      socket.setTimeout self.timeouts[name]    self.timeout  function           console.log  Never called.         socket.end                 return socket;       1. Keep alive socket  reuse         Even if the new socket case were overcome  the very next request via the same logic would again call request.setTimeout  this time immediately calling socket.setTimeout and overwriting the existing socket s setTimeout.   Is the req.setTimeout necessary?   Can we avoid it when keep alives are used?   Can we check for socket._idleNext or something else to ensure the same functionality without blowing away the existing socket timeout? ,CrabDude,closed,1,2013-08-27 20:00:14,2014-08-28 00:23:53,,,,0,1

9094,request/request,647,Simplified Stream/Pipe Error Handling,Request is super simple to use  but it s not so simple to handle errors  especially when piping.  Normally error handling with pipes is very straightforward:      javascript fs.createReadStream   file1.txt    .pipe  fs.createWriteStream   file2.txt     .on   error   handleErr   // <  all read/write/stream errors can be caught here .on   close   proceed  ;      With request  that doesn t seem to be the case:      javascript request   http://google.com/doodle.png    .pipe  fs.createWriteStream  doodle.png    .on   error   handleErr   // <  many errors don t make it here .on   close   proceed  ;      Callbacks are not necessary when producing streams as it s mixing two different asynchronous conventions  though the presence of a callback could indicate which one you intend to use.  Could stream events be used when a callback is not provided  or am I crazy? ,protometa,closed,9,2013-09-05 19:24:38,2014-08-28 00:22:41,,,,0,1

9081,request/request,660,Work in Progress: Request re write for new streams.,This is nowhere near finished and most of the tests still don t pass.  This is full re write of request from the ground up. It is built on top of new style streams  streams2  and there is a concerted effort to do more of the work in dependencies.     Deprecations   piping to a destination w/ a callback parameter forces buffering.    request url  function  e  resp      .pipe fs.createWriteStream file   will now have the side effect of also buffering the entire response in to memory. Because new style streams can be piped well after nextTick   we don t have a good way to know if we should or should not buffer the response other than the callback parameter. we still will not ever buffer the response when a callback is not given.   JSON.stringify request url   probably breaks.   Deprecating the old hacky getSafe   function will dramatically improve performance and  for the most part  stringifying options with sockets attached is a bad idea.   all signing  cookies  and other non default options will require the user explicitly install their dependency.  The dep list is growing exponentially and because of the way cookies and signing work in particular it isn t possible for request to support these features without adding code to request itself. Rather than continue to let the dep list grow forever in to the future  and with the understanding that one day we may even want a feature that requires a compiled dependency  I m going to move to a model where we check for the dep when you use the feature and throw if you didn t install it.  This will not be the case for default options which will still have their deps included.     Features   NEW STYLE STREAMS    gzip support  enabled by default.  We now default to including the Accept Encoding header for gzip and transparently decompressing the stream in the underlying HTTP Duplex stream.   less memory copies when using binary response buffering.  Basically we just moved to @rvagg s  bl  module which we pipe ourself to in order to buffer the response.  bl  gives us a compatible buffer API but actually stores all the chunks in an array so we save on the big memcopy we used to do.  The code is also much cleaner  which is always the case when you re write a module that hasn t had a full re write since node.js had promises built in :  ,mikeal,closed,12,2013-09-13 08:41:09,2014-08-19 15:12:40,,,,1,1

9070,request/request,671,Request.JS not returning the same HTML as my browser ,I am trying to scrape Vimeo and I am not getting returned any of the content related to the URL with query string. All I get is the static Vimeo HTML elements located in the page header and footer. I do not get the thumbnail video gallery grid. Here is my code:      var request = require  request      cheerio = require  cheerio      searchURL =  http://vimeo.com/search?q=angularjs ;  request searchURL  function err  resp  body     if err      throw err;     = cheerio.load body ;    // the following will properly log the element s text to console    // since it is part of the static Vimeo header nav bar   console.log     site_header .join a  .text   ;    // the following will log  Please try again  since it s dynamic content   // which is related to the search query   console.log     page_header h1  .text   ;    // the following code targets the dynamically generated gallery grid   // but it does not log anything since Vimeo won t return it       browse_content .browse_videos li a  .each function        console.log this.attr  href   ;     ;   ;        If you run that and then compare the HTML returned by Vimeo you can see it does not match what you would see if you went to  http://vimeo.com/search?q=angularjs  in your browser.   I am thinking I might have to add a user agent string to the request to let Vimeo know my scraper is a browser. If I am right about that then how do I do that?

9060,request/request,681,Blank passwords result in different Auth headers,Some web services have RESTful APIs where you authenticate using your API key as your username and a blank password. I was using such a service  when I was stopped by this bug which only happens with blank passwords:      request.get url .auth  username     true ;      will send a different Authentication header than      request.get url        auth:           user:  username           pass:             sendImmediately: true         ;          Even though these two should be functionally identical.  To demonstrate this bug  I used RequestBin to log my HTTP requests  and indeed  these two different methods result in different Authentication headers being sent. Please run the following code for yourself and [see the results here] http://requestb.in/14iakdo1?inspect .      var request = require  request  ;  var requestBin =  http://requestb.in/14iakdo1 ; // Go to http://requestb.in to create a new bin var username =  username ; var password =   ;  // Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6 request.get requestBin .auth username password true ;  // Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6dW5kZWZpbmVk // This Auth header is WRONG. request.get requestBin        auth:           user: username          pass: password          sendImmediately: true         ;      I d just use the first method  but it means I can t have my extra options or callback.  Which is a bummer.         UPDATE:   Changing  auth.pass  to  auth.password  sends the _correct_ Auth header  somehow.      // Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6 request.get requestBin        auth:           user: username          password: password          sendImmediately: true         ;             UPDATE 2:   This might explain why there s an extra  dW5kZWZpbmVk  in the wrong Auth header: http://www.base64decode.org/dec/dW5kZWZpbmVk/ ,ncase,closed,0,2013-10-11 19:48:06,2013-10-24 21:27:35,,,,0,1

9054,request/request,687,pipe API have performance issue?,I write a app for reverse proxy. Using request just need a few codes to complete. But yesterday I found s stranger issue.

The below image is using reverse proxy app:  [reverse] https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5635024/1387623/23b598fa 3ba0 11e3 91f5 95d546b52d63.PNG   And this is accessing the service directly  the service is hosted in IIS  [direct] https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5635024/1387626/435572ca 3ba0 11e3 97c4 354f40440e80.PNG   As you can see  using reverse proxy app  there is a almost 200ms delay before client get the response.  If I use res.end    there is no delay.  So any one know what is the problems?  BTW: my node version is 0.10.21. ,JamesYYang,closed,2,2013-10-23 05:03:57,2013-11-12 06:39:56,,,,0,1

9048,request/request,693,Feature request: an extra parameter to the request callback,Consider a typical Express/node.js app  such as a web scraper  one that takes a user request  parses that url to make a request to the  real  website   scrapes or otherwise modifies the data  or headers  and returns it.  The handler for the user request  the express route  looks like      exports.foo = function originalRequest  originalResponse        // parse originalRequest to get a url  maybe some other options     Request.get theURL  theCallbackFunction ;        and theCallbackFunction would look something like      function theCallbackFunction error  response  body        // check for errors     var dataToReturn =   ;     // do stuff with a parser like Cheerio to collect dataToReturn     // more options   see comments below     originalResponse.send dataToReturn ;        My issue is that originalResponse is _not in scope in the callback._  Also  the callback may have additional options that should be passed down from the Express route.  For example  it might want to parse originalRequest and have an  xml  or a  json  or a  deep  or  shallow  option  etc.  There is no easy way to pas these to the callback.  One option is to next these two functions inside each other  but that forces a certain style   which I hate   plus  if theCallbackFunction makes another async call to yetAnotherCallback...  this gets really messy.  What I have been doing is declaring another variable outside the functions and putting originalResponse there  which seems to work but is also a bit clunky.  And I m not sure if that s really safe if multiple requests come in at the same time.  I m brand new to node.js  but in a  traditional  Java / threaded world that wouldn t be safe.   My  ideal  fix would be for there to be an additional parameter to the request callback  so that the express route might look something like      exports.foo = function originalRequest  originalResponse        // parse originalRequest to get a url  maybe some other options     var passMeOnDown =           originalResponse : originalResponse          specialOptionA :  xml       ;     Request.get theURL  passMeOnDown   theCallbackFunction ;        and then the signature for theCallbackFunction becomes      function error  response  body  passMeOnDown       NOTE: I m coming from Java and brand new to Javascript so maybe  with the wonders of Javascript s loosely defined parameters and variable length arg lists  this can already be done very simply.  If so a brief example code would be nice   Plus  I m sure I m not the first person to ask about this  ,MorganConrad,closed,2,2013-10-29 16:10:15,2013-10-29 16:55:03,,,,0,1

That is because hasHeader is case insensitive and returns true  then the split method gets applied to undefined and crashes the application.  One could argue that headers should be spelled using only lowercase. However  mixed case headers used to work with a previous version of request  thus I suggest to incorporate this patch to ensure that legacy code does not suddenly crash after updating request. ,pastaclub,closed,0,2013-11-26 14:45:32,2013-11-26 17:28:32,,,,1,1

For example  tell  request  to wait 2000 milliseconds before reading the DOM.      var opts =     headers:   User Agent :  request      jar: true    url:  http://soundcloud.com/search/sounds?q=avicii   ; request opts  function  error  response  body      if   error    response.statusCode == 200         console.log body              ,wle8300,closed,1,2013-12-19 20:44:48,2013-12-19 20:56:04,,,,0,1

Given the many issues that I see open referring to OAuth  I wonder if the problem is larger than just outdated documentation  and OAuth support is actually broken at the moment of writing.  Can anybody suggest if this is the case  or offer a request OAuth example that is working with Twitter? Thanks.  Giacecco ,giacecco,closed,1,2013-12-31 11:33:01,2013-12-31 11:53:49,,,,0,1

Basically I ve limited the API to what is necessary for this library and made some things more flexible. E.g. adding a cookie to the jar   you can now do this by passing in a cookie string  a json object or an instance of a  Cookie  object. Removing a cookie from the jar is also easy. Also added the ability to export the jar or cookie via the  toJSON  method.  /cc @stash @mikeal ,lalitkapoor,closed,5,2014-01-19 01:16:05,2014-08-27 23:28:16,,,,1,1

The issue is fixed in the phantomjs webserver  but apparently still not shipped :shipit: or it s due to me running on windows  https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11487 . Since it doesn t really matter and most clients do output the headers in Pascal Case. I thought it might be a good idea to address it here.  @camme I ran into the  cannot get a session token  issue. When connection directly to phantomjs from webdriverjs. With this  fix  it works.  ,albertjan,closed,6,2014-03-03 15:59:30,2014-08-27 23:28:07,,,,1,1

It is causing my Node app memory usage to spike unpredictably  most of the time I m running between 400 and 600 MB  but occasionally I almost reach my Heroku limit of 1GB which messes things up. Is there some setting I need to change  maybe timeout or poll/maxSockets?  I ll also supply the code block I m using.  When I comment it out  I run perfectly steady around 300 MB for days at a time  so the issue w/ my memory spikes definitely seems to be with request or maybe pkgcloud.       javascript request idocs[ikey].tweet.user.profile_image_url.replace  _normal.    _bigger.   .on  response   function response        avatars.push path.basename path.dirname response.request.path      /    path.basename response.request.path  ;     var headers =   ;     if  response.headers    response.headers[ content type ]            headers[ content type ] = response.headers[ content type ];           if  response.headers    response.headers[ content length ]            headers[ content length ] = response.headers[ content length ];           response.headers = headers;   .pipe client.upload       container: process.env.RACKSPACE_CONTAINER      remote: path.basename path.dirname idocs[ikey].tweet.user.profile_image_url      /            path.basename idocs[ikey].tweet.user.profile_image_url.replace  _normal.    _bigger.       function err  result        if  err            console.log err ;          ;       [nodetime_http] https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/46009/2338744/0334c652 a4ad 11e3 8745 b2a456ea5065.png  ,Brade,closed,2,2014-03-05 21:27:57,2014-11-10 06:07:38,,,,0,1

8904,request/request,837,Recursive call?,From the examples I could not determine if there was a way to make a recursive call? The need comes out of a REST OData call where odata.nextLink property on the JSON coming back may be set indicating that there is more data available so the natural thing to do would be to change the URL in the options an reissue the request. But specifying the callback becomes problematic 1  Because I am not sure how to indicate to request that any given request is the  final  one. 2  It seems to necessitate building a global variable that would contain the accumulation of the  n  REST calls. Ideas? ,KevinBurton,closed,3,2014-03-10 16:41:14,2014-03-10 22:40:17,,,,0,1

8893,request/request,848,Pool  agent  maxSockets   documentation,There is little to none documentation on  pool    agent     maxSockets .  See  588  which points to  428  which is not great.  Indeed  the solution to set  pool.maxSockets  will bypass the use of  globalPool : https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/bfea018c3eaf83b18d49001797096f990b59b446/request.js L111      javascript if   self.pool    self.pool  == false  self.pool = globalPool      This is probably a bug: we do want to be able to use the  globalPool  _and_ still set some agent options like  maxSockets . See  617.  The code seems to read  maxSockets  in addition to  pool.maxSockets   and this would bypass the bug  but this option is not documented.  Also  if we want to pass other options to the agents  we cannot use  pool.    In fact we can pass other options to the agents with  agentOptions   which is not documented either.  Finally  there is no documentation to describe the  pool  object like expected and constructed in getAgent    see  588   and it seems it s only usable with a pool constructed by Request itself  accessible only via the response of a request : we probably can t expect users to construct the pool key used in getAgent  .  So I propose this: 1/ Deprecate the use of  pool.maxSockets  because it collides with the pool object agent caching  and breaks globalPool usage  maybe add an explicit option to tell  use the Request global pool too?  2/ Also deprecated  maxSockets   document  agentOptions  instead which seems to be well suited for this. 3/ Either deprecate  pool  altogether  or document the key format for  pool   or add a function to request to construct it  so that users don t have to know the internal format  that could change . Even better: add a function to directly construct a  pool   and  pool  would be an opaque object to forward to request    this would be similar to getAgent  just isolated .  Finally  some questsions:  1/ Why do we even have a pool of agents like that? Could we have some use case examples where it is useful?  and put them in the README.md?   See  476: they seem to try to have different  maxSockets  per domain  but it s not working since the code that adds the host   port to the key is only for node <= 0.4. I suppose it s because since node 0.6 the  http.Agent  can work with multiple domains  so that part was removed from the key  but the  http.Agent   maxSockets  is global to the agent  not per domain  so this useful feature is lost. https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/bfea018c3eaf83b18d49001797096f990b59b446/request.js L598 L604  2/ How do I force the usage of an externally built agent  like it s done with  http.Request ? See  565. I can t find a way to pass the agent via  pool  since I must know the key  and the key is not the same depending on the requests  at the very least it is  http  or  https  . Maybe add the same api as http.request: just accept an  agent  option?

This is problematic in cases like using bower programmatically with a local registry. While you could delete process.env.HTTP_PROXY to gain access to the proxy  it would would break connectivity to the outside world at the same time.

8885,request/request,856,Performance degrades when using request to make http calls to EC2 instance,I originally asked this question  nodejitsu/node http proxy 614  due to some issues I was having with [nodejitsu/node http proxy] https://github.com/nodejitsu/node http proxy   however  during my testing  I discovered that it was affecting the request module as well  so I figured it might be worth posting my findings here as well to see if anyone might have encountered anything like this before.  Basically  I was trying to create a simple http proxy for an EC2 instance; however  I realized that anything I put through http proxy was being delayed considerably. I wanted to make sure it wasn t a node thing so I tried the same requests with http.get  and everything was fine. I then wanted to isolate http proxy and to my surprise  when I made the get call with request  it also had considerably performance degradation.   So here is where I m at after messing with this over the weekend; I ve placed the following server code up onto a public EC2 instance so you can test it yourself  to rule out the possibility of my internet being the problem :      javascript var http = require  http  ;  var server = http.createServer function  req  res        res.end  Hello World  ;   .listen 3000 ;  // This was added to test what others have reported as fixing the issue server.on  connection   function  socket         use strict ;     console.log  server.on.connection   setNoDelay  ;     socket.setNoDelay true ;   ;      The public ip address of the server is 54.209.167.233  When I request http://54.209.167.233:3000/ in my browser  I m using the [Advanced REST Client] https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced rest client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en US  for chrome   I consistently get a response between 60 120ms.   If I run the following code  both cases respond for me in roughly the same amount of time  about 100ms each :      javascript var http = require  http  ;  // Stream request console.time  stream  ; http.get  http://54.209.167.233:3000/   function res        var data =   ;     res.on  data   function  chunk            data  = chunk;       ;     res.on  end   function  chunk            console.log data.toString   ;         console.timeEnd  stream  ;       ;   ;  // Pipe request console.time  pipe  ; http.get  http://54.209.167.233:3000/   function  res        res.pipe process.stdout ;     res.on  end   function  chunk            console.log  ;         console.timeEnd  pipe  ;       ;   ;      However  if I run the following example  I get times in the 800 2000ms range:      javascript var request = require  request  ;  // Get using request module console.time  request  ; request.get       url:  http://54.209.167.233:3000/     function  err  res  body        console.log body ;     console.timeEnd  request  ;   ;      My original tests involved using [nodejitsu/node http proxy] https://github.com/nodejitsu/node http proxy   and if you are curious to see the same result there  you can run the following example  and then request the response from localhost  I also get times in the 800 2000ms range :      javascript var http = require  http  ; var httpProxy = require  http proxy  ;  var proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer  ; proxy.on  proxyRes   function  res        res.pipe process.stdout ;     res.on  end   function  chunk            console.log  ;         console.timeEnd  proxy  ;       ;   ;  // Proxy requests http.createServer function  req  res        console.time  proxy  ;     proxy.web req  res    target:  http://54.209.167.233:3000/    ;   .listen 3000 ;      This is as simple as I can make the cases and still illustrate the problem. Clearly it has something to do with EC2  but the fact that the http requests come back in a reasonable amount of time makes me think that it also has something to do with the way request  and [nodejitsu/node http proxy] https://github.com/nodejitsu/node http proxy  for that matter  are handling requests at the node level. ,sgerace,closed,17,2014-04-07 14:57:08,2014-11-10 06:11:14,,,,0,1

However  there are two issues    1. The http request doesn t even get to the global Agent s queue until request.end   is called. 2. Under high load the request might actually be queued behind several requests.  Under normal circumstances  that s fine. However  under high load when the node server is handling a lot of traffic  we don t want the time out timer to start until the request actually gets a socket. We want to measure the timeout from the point the request was actually made from the host until it came back. I will be happy to submit a patch for this. ,dineshjoshi,closed,6,2014-04-09 20:40:19,2014-11-10 06:48:09,,,,0,1

8862,request/request,879,prevent hanging when piping empty streams to request,This not really a bug  since this is supposed to be addressed by https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/4969  However  when using one line proxying in a connect/express application  some previous middleware may have consumed or switched the request object to old streaming mode. This causes pipes coming to request   to wait for an  end  event which is not gonna happend again.  As a robustness concern  it would be cool if request checked if it is being piped ended readable streams and not wait for an  end  event to happen but still used headers from that stream if it is an Http.IncomingMessage object. ,Floby,open,0,2014-04-25 13:31:36,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1
8861,request/request,880,Disabling features based on the status of optionalDependencies causes confusion,I just spent a few hours trying to figure out why I couldn t get cookie jars working with request  and it turned out that the  tough cookie  dependency was missing. I m not sure if npm failed to install it or what  but since it s part of  optionalDependencies   I never noticed. Finally  by digging into the source for request  I realized that it was marked as optional  and I manually installed it with npm.  I think it s okay to disable functionality based on missing libraries  but the absolute last thing the library should do is provide  stub  functionality that pretends that everything is okay  but in reality is doing nothing. This is _incredibly_ confusing.  Would it be possible to make it throw an error if you try to use cookies without  tough cookie  installed  or is it better to make the dependency mandatory instead?  I m happy to send pull requests for either option   ,nkohari,closed,5,2014-04-27 20:58:06,2014-11-10 05:44:53,,,,0,1

8854,request/request,887,Error: You cannot pipe after data has been emitted from the response.,I am encountering an issue where I will get the  You cannot pipe after data has been emitted from the response.  error when trying to pipe to a WriteStream. This only occurs when there has been a delay between when the  request    call was made  and when the  readStream.pipe writeStream   call is made.

8851,request/request,890,Allow recursive request.defaults,This change allows you to call  request.defaults  on the function that is returned from a call to  request.defaults   The idea is to be able to recursively call  .defaults  to override or add new configs to the previous defaults.  For example      var proxiedRequest = request.defaults  proxy:  http://proxy1.com   ; var nonRedirectedProxyRequest = proxiedRequest.defaults  followRedirect: false  ;      In this example  proxiedRequest  would just have the  proxy  as the default and  nonRedirectedProxyRequest  would have both the  proxy  and  followRedirects  as defaults.  You can also do something like      var r1 = request.defaults     timeout: 1000    followRedirect: false   ; var r2 = r1.defaults  timeout: 3000  ;      in which case  r1  would not follow redirects and have a timeout of 1000ms and  r2  would also not follow redirects but would have a timeout of 3000ms ,brooklynDev,closed,4,2014-05-06 14:47:07,2014-08-22 11:51:04,,,,1,1

8824,request/request,917,Invalid protocol error is emitted before the handlers can subscribe to it.,Invalid protocol error is raised in a function called by the Request object constructor  before any I/O operation. So  the event is emitted in the same event loop round when the listeners were not added yet  and the error is lost.  For example:  var myDomain = require  domain  .create  ; myDomain.on  error   function  err         console.log  Shouldn t be here   ;   ;  domain.run function          req = request  url: url_with_no_protocol   ;      req.on  error   function err            console.log  Should be here  but not  ;        ;   ;  The problem is request.js: if   self.httpModule  return this.emit  error   new Error  Invalid protocol:     protocol    It can be solve adding a nextTick call  so the emit call will run in the next event loop round  after the handlers are set.   I ve already fix it  so if you don t mind I will file a PR. ,gusajz,closed,2,2014-05-31 14:31:36,2014-06-04 16:50:43,,,,0,1

8817,request/request,924,Proposal: Multi part Form Data as a request option,   Background  Multipart Form Uploads  MPUs  currently take advantage of the  form data  module. This handles uploads for us  but the interface is [confusing to many users] https://github.com/mikeal/request/issues/345  and seems to clash with the normal  request options   interface.        javascript // From README Forms var r = request.post  http://service.com/upload   someOptionalCallback ; var form = r.form   form.append  my_field    my_value   form.append  my_buffer   new Buffer [1  2  3]   // ...      I have a callback chain that modifies an  options  object before calling  request options  . Supporting MPU data means passing a second object of form data to append later  or attaching the form data to this options object and then removing it later. It would be much easier   intuitive if request could handle Multipart form data via the normal options object  just as it does for all other parameters.       Proposal  I d like to propose handling the simple multi part form case via the options passed to request. The interface would look like this:      javascript var options =       url:  http://service.com/upload       mpu:           my_filed:  my_value           my_buffer: new Buffer [1 2 3]         ; request options  someOptionalCallback ;       request  would check for  mpu  in the options object. If found  it would get a new FormData object from  self.form    and call  form.append  on all mpu properties. This would handle most MPU use cases  like the README example above   and we would keep the current  form    method for developers who need to handle some advanced case.   Open questions: 1. What should the option be called? I d like to use  form   but it s already taken. formMPU? formUpload?     I m happy to tackle this in a PR  but I wanted to get some feedback from @mikeal et. all and a confirmation that this was desired before I did. ,FredKSchott,closed,2,2014-06-06 01:22:41,2014-10-14 18:27:26,,,,0,1

8807,request/request,934,Special character in url are ignored,I m using request to foward web app REST request to my JAVA backend. So it may happen that I have           ...  character as filter in my URL.   If I log the option object passed to request just before the request is made the uri contains the special character but it s as if the special character is ignored behinds the scene.  eg.  uri: http://backurl/resources/profilresponsabiliterole?page=1 start=0 limite=10 filtre=[roleCode roleDescription dateDebut dateFin actif]:like:unit   Returns me an empty object but if I receive this  without the     uri: http://backurl/resources/profilresponsabiliterole?page=1 start=0 limite=10 filtre=[roleCode roleDescription dateDebut dateFin actif]:like:unite    It works ok.  I m using utf 8 encoding.  Any ideas ?  Thank you ,jfbelisle,closed,1,2014-06-17 13:27:40,2014-11-10 05:56:41,,,,0,1

8802,request/request,939,Support externally created tough cookie jars,In one of my projects  I create multiple tough cookie jars in a phase  where request isn t required. When I pass these jars to a request object  things fail. This is due to request requires calls to  getCookieString  and  setCookie  to be made synchronously. When using request.jar   to create a tough cookie jar  these two methods are overwritten and actually call  getCookieStringSync  and  setCookieSync  respectively. When using an externally created tough cookie jar  this overwrite does not happen. For fixing this  I applied slight changes to request.js  where the actual cookie reading / cookie writing happens. ,benkroeger,closed,6,2014-06-23 18:10:58,2014-12-22 20:28:53,,,,0,1

No idea why yet. Perhaps it should be an official API feature rather than an internal based hack.  The attribut is simply not defined in node webkit using the same version of request. Would the internal node version be the culprit? ,naggie,closed,3,2014-06-24 07:26:04,2014-11-10 05:47:29,,,,0,1

8793,request/request,948,Incorrect cookie date handling with CookieJar  mangled expires dates ,Consider the following code:      javascript var request = require  request  ;  var cookieJar = request.jar  ; var loginUrl =  https://www.boots.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/LogonForm?storeId=10052 langId= 1 catalogId=11051 URL=http 3A 2F 2Fwww.boots.com 2F ;  request.get   url: loginUrl  jar: cookieJar    function err  res  body        console.log res.headers ;     console.log cookieJar ;   ;      This code makes an HTTP GET request to the boots.com login page  and then spits out the response headers and the contents of the cookie jar.  If I examine the res headers  they look something like:            server:  IBM_HTTP_Server       pragma:  No cache       ....more headers  snip ...       set cookie :      [          WCDC_CURRID=ABC123; Expires=Thu  26 Jun 14 18:59:58 GMT; Path=/           ....more cookies  snip ....     ]        Notice the expires date of the cookie  Thu  26 Jun 14 18:59:58 GMT . Now examine the contents of the cookie jar:        _jar:       store:          idx:    www.boots.com :              / :                               WCDC_CURRID: Cookie= WCDC_CURRID=ABC123; Expires=Mon  26 Jun 142000 18:59:58 GMT; Path=/; hostOnly=true; aAge=416ms; cAge=416ms                 ... more cookies  snip ....      Notice that the cookie expires date is  Mon  26 Jun 142000 18:59:58 GMT   the year 142000? WTF ?  It s not just this one cookie either  all of them seem to have mangled dates. Some of them even look like this:      BP: Cookie= BP=; Expires=undefined  0NaN undefined NaN 0NaN:0NaN:0NaN GMT; Domain=boots.com; Path=/; hostOnly=false; aAge=415ms; cAge=415ms       Anything obvious I m missing that s causing this? A bug with tough cookie perhaps. I tried the Boots login page in Chrome browser and all the cookie expires dates seem to be interpreted correctly. ,Sironfoot,closed,6,2014-06-26 18:21:18,2015-09-17 21:44:45,lalitkapoor,,,0,1

8790,request/request,951,Add support for gzip content decoding,My apologies in advance for adding yet another gzip implementation for you to consider  but it appears that work on the alternative solutions   303   458   464   660  has stalled while interest in a solution is still high   539   725   747  and requires non trivial effort to implement outside of the library  although it s certainly not horrible .  Unlike the previous solutions  this pull request supports stream based usage and does not introduce any backwards incompatible behavior.  It is intended to serve as a bridge for the 2.x series until 3.0 is ready for release  at which points its existing gzip implementation can supersede this one.  This commit introduces the  decodeContent  boolean option to allow users to explicitly request decoding of supported response content and inclusion of the appropriate content negotiation header   Accept Encoding    if unspecified.  Although  deflate  support is also common on servers  this commit does not add  deflate  support due to compatibility issues with non conformant  raw  deflate encodings and the lack of a compelling reason to support it given  gzip  s wide availability.

8787,request/request,954,HPE_INVALID_CONTENT_LENGTH on HEAD request   core Node.js http module handles it fine,HEAD requests with the  request  module on some shortened  301 redirecting URLs return the following error:        [Error: Parse Error] bytesParsed: 123  code:  HPE_INVALID_CONTENT_LENGTH         For example  I get this on http://cnb.cx/1vtyQyv. Very easy to reproduce  node v0.10.29  request v2.36.0 :      var request = require  request  ;  request   url: http://cnb.cx/1vtyQyv   method:  HEAD     function err  res        console.log err  res ;   ;      The error is thrown from within [Node.js s core http parser] https://github.com/mattn/http server/blob/master/http_parser.c . Doing a GET request with  request  works fine  however   it follows the 301 and returns the contents of the specified page. Also  as pointed out in an answer to my [Stack Overflow question] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24538520/node js head request returns hpe invalid content length error   the core Node.js  http.request  function has no problem with it  which is what leads me to think this is a bug in  request .      var http = require  http  ;  http.request     host:  cnb.cx     path:  /1vtyQyv     method:  HEAD     function res      console.dir res ;   res.resume  ;   .end  ;      For your benefit  here is the result of  curl  HEAD request on this URL:        curl  I http://cnb.cx/1vtyQyv HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Server: nginx Date: Wed  02 Jul 2014 18:16:05 GMT Content Type: text/html; charset=utf 8 Connection: keep alive Cache Control: private; max age=90 Content Length: 124 Location: http://www.cnbc.com/id/101793181 Mime Version: 1.0 Set Cookie: _bit=53b44c65 00194 0369a 281cf10a;domain=.cnb.cx;expires=Mon Dec 29 18:16:05 2014;path=/; HttpOnly      Content Length looks fine  and the body length is in fact 124  as can be verified with  curl http://cnb.cx/1vtyQyv   wc  c   so I don t know why the error is happening in the first place.  This is an issue  by the way  because I m using [node unshortener] https://github.com/Swizec/node unshortener  which makes repeated HEAD requests until it finds the full URL. ,tobek,closed,2,2014-07-02 21:26:56,2014-07-02 22:28:37,,,,0,1

8785,request/request,956,How select the submit button with a form with 2 submit?,Hi all    I m currently writing some API tests for my work. The basics of _Request_ are really easy. I was able to write my first test with _Mocha_ really fast. I use waterfall  function from [async] https://github.com/caolan/async  librairy to chain the requests.  But now I m blocked. I have to submit a form where there is two buttons to submit it: _Save_ and _Delete_.      HTML <dd id= save element > <input type= submit  name= save  id= save  value= Save  class= ui button ui widget ui state default ui corner all ui state hover  role= button  aria disabled= false ></dd> <dd> <input type= submit  name= delete  id= delete  value= Delete  class= ui button ui widget ui state default ui corner all  role= button  aria disabled= false ></dd>      Here what I did.      JavaScript global.request = request.defaults  json: true  jar: true            Javascript async.waterfall [   function cb        var params;     params =         url:  http://baseURL/login         form:  username:  myuser   password:  mypwd        ;     request.post params  function err  response  body          cb err  body ;       ;         function body  cb        request.post  http://baseURL/FormPage    form:   delete:  Delete    ;     ] ;      I m well log in  but my second request seems not to be taken into account.

Please try not to mind my ignorance on the subject if you can.  Basically I am trying to use your middleware to Authenticate with Instagram using express.  I have been trying to follow Instagram Server side  Explicit  flow  which is a 2 step operation:   request an access code   request an access token  Right now my server is set up using:      express         = require  express    app             = express  ;      and to initiate the first step I am using:      app.get  /   function req  res     var url =  https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=  CLIENT ID   redirect_uri=  YOUR REDIRECT URI   response_type=code    res.redirect url ;   ;      And then I use this to handle Instagram s callback:      app.get  /auth/instagram/callback   function req  res      console.log  Instagram code:    req.query.code ;    var data =       url : url     client_id  :  CLIENT ID       client_secret  :  CLIENT SECRET       grant_type  :  authorization_code       redirect_uri  :  YOUR REDIRECT URI       code  : req.query.code    ;    var url =  https://api.instagram.com/oauth/access_token ;    request.post     method:  POST     url: url    body: JSON.stringify data          function  e  r  body       console.log  The body:    body ;      ;    ;      unfortunately despite receiving a valid access code from Instagram from the first step  I do get the following response. I also tried hardcoding an actual client ID  client secret and even code in the data field but keep on getting the following response.      The body:    code: 400    error_type:  OAuthException     error_message:  You must provide a client_id         Any light on this would be most appreciated.

8757,request/request,984,Cleanup response.body buffer creation to use Buffer.concat  ,I just noticed that there was an unnecessary loop over the array of response body buffers  where  Buffer.concat    would work just as well and take care of the complexity for you. Docs: http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html buffer_class_method_buffer_concat_list_totallength  I also took the chance to clean up some confusing/vague variables:    buffer  was actually an array of Buffers  each one being a chunk of the final response body buffer     now  bodyDataChunks     bodyLen  could have meant length of the array     now  bodyTotalSize     body  could still be modified before becoming the final  response.body      now  bodyData   All tests are passing  and the update was working fine when I tested it inside my own application.     Note: Buffer.concat   was introduced and has [remained unchanged since v0.8.0] http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.8.0/api/buffer.html buffer_class_method_buffer_concat_list_totallength   so request s version compatibility will remain unchanged. ,FredKSchott,closed,4,2014-07-30 01:38:55,2014-08-11 23:16:02,,,,1,1

8742,request/request,999,Fix fallback for browserify for optional modules.,Hello. In the commit 811dddc4090b4a6d69d470d356f35756eb03e340 there was a change that made request incompatible with browserify again. The error being thrown is   Cannot read property  require  of undefined  . Not sure if this is the best way to fix it  but it sure fixes it :   If I have the time one of these days  and you think it is a good idea  and want to keep supporting a browserified request  I could try to look into writing a small test suite for the browser  so at least these things will get picked up by CI.  Also. I think I said it before  but thanks again for this awesome module  Please tell me if you want anything changed with the patch  and I ll fix it up. ,eiriksm,closed,3,2014-08-10 09:43:24,2014-08-11 16:59:23,,,,1,1

8736,request/request,1005,3.0    Cut optional dependencies,Optional dependencies have been tricky and painful since we moved to them.  I don t like the idea of having to throw at runtime because you didn t install something. That doesn t mean I think that we should just take all those deps back as regular dependencies.  The deps I think should just return to being regular dependencies are:  form data  and  tunnel agent . In 3.0 I think we should make a breaking change to authentication and signing. Basically  we should define an object that can be passed in to  auth  which can handle all the authentication and signing use cases. Then signing libraries can produce those objects and we can just accept them  removing the need for optionalDeps. Example:      javascript var o = require  oauth sign    consumer_key:key  access_token:token       request = require  request     ; request  https://site/needsauth    auth:o  json:true   function  e  resp  body   console.log body          We can handle cookies essentially the same way  and that interface has already been pretty standardized by @lalitkapoor so it should be even easier. ,mikeal,closed,9,2014-08-11 21:59:51,2014-10-17 19:33:25,,,,0,1

8725,request/request,1016,toJSON no longer results in an infinite loop  returns simple objects,This commit is an attempt to solve issue  1011 where instead of succeeding or throwing   JSON.stringify request   and  JSON.stringify resp   can cause infinite loops. This solution involves returning much smaller objects without any circular references so that serialization is possible.  The purpose of this PR is to look for feedback   keep the conversation going on whether this is a direction we want to go.       Context / Thinking  taken from  1011 :  > ... when the unknowing user serializes the object  intentionally and unintentionally  would they rather the default behavior be to throw an error  or successfully serialize only the basic properties? >  > I definitely see the value in throwing and letting the user handle it every time  but this also means that every user will need to go into the object and find out what fields they need themselves. I imagine it s much more likely for the general user not to care  and maybe even prefer to have it extract only the basic  most valuable info. Also  if an expert user didn t like our simple serializer  they could just remove it  either through an option we provide or manually via  delete r.toJSON  .       Open Questions 1. Are there any other crucial properties? I just chose the few that seemed important 2. Do we want to keep  json stringify safe  for serializing a json body object? I m not sure if we d actually want to allow complex objects / objects with circular dependencies to be submitted via request  since they aren t really valid JSON. It might be helpful for users to remove this dependency/functionality for 3.0 3. Is this considered a breaking change? In some cases it didn t infinite loop  so for those cases it definitely is one.     /cc @mikeal @netpoetica ,FredKSchott,closed,1,2014-08-20 23:13:00,2014-08-21 19:45:40,,,,1,1

8718,request/request,1023,Race condition with gzip encoding and large responses,We have run into an issue where the maximum call stack size gets exceeded when we are using gzip encoding and there is a large response such that the Gunzip data stream will buffer. The cause is that this line https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/master/request.js L955 is being called before the gunzip has completed and therefore this line  https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/master/request.js L1002  has not been executed yet  since  dataStream  is now the Gunzip . This causes a recursive call to  response.emit  end    and back to  response.on  close   .  To fix this  it seems like  self._ended = true  should be set when the response has closed and not when the gunzip stream has completed. I m not sure of the internals of how  self._ended  is used though. ,mridgway,closed,0,2014-08-27 01:17:51,2014-08-27 21:28:46,,,,0,1

8709,request/request,1032,How to request HTTPS with self signed keys,I am currently building a node module with a secure REST API and I am using Request.  I use HTTPS with a self signed key  on the server  to secure the connection  but since they are self signed  I must set strictSSL to false. The documentation for Request mentions  however   to use your own certificate authority  you need to specify an agent that was created with that CA as an option .  How would I go about making sure that the request client would only connect to the server if it has the correct self signed key? It s fine if I need to keep some keys on the client servers.  PS. I m aware that there s a reason for official CAs  but I am determined to not use them. Most developers will only be using my module between servers and have no need to pay a CA for an officially signed key. All I need is protect from potential MITM attacks.

8704,request/request,1037,Common API documentation format for all Node packages,I m the developer behind [Dash] http://kapeli.com/dash   an API documentation browser.  The current state of node packages is that each package has its own custom format for providing documentation  most in a README . This makes things extremely hard if you want to collect all these docs under one app and also an inconvenience for users  as they have to learn how to reference and navigate each doc format of each package they use.  I ve asked the NPM team to promote a doc format that node packages should use in hope that the community would embrace it and they ve asked me to contact the maintainers of the most popular packages and get them to agree on a format  and if it gets popular with the community it will get supported by NPM as well. The NPM issue is tracked here: https://github.com/npm/newww/issues/100.  Some questions: 1. Have you considered using an API documentation generator for your node package? I ve heard of JSDoc over and over  but I ve never seen a node package use it for their docs 2. Do you think it would be better if the APIs of node packages would be documented inside the code  where a doc generator would turn them into actual docs   and the READMEs be used just as a guide? 3. Any thoughts about this issue? ,Kapeli,closed,6,2014-08-30 00:19:21,2014-09-10 05:13:34,,,,0,1

8679,request/request,1062,Original headers object is modified,Hello there   I was just debugging something for a while  because request is modifying the headers object  which was a problem because I had my own reference to that obect.  Here is an example. Let s say you have a variable called headers with some standard headers  empty in this case .      js var headers =    request  url:  http://example.com   headers: headers  json:  a: 1   method:  POST         After doing this request the value of the variable headers is:      js   accept:  application/json      content type :  application/json      content length : 7        This did cause a problem in my case  because my next request was not working  when using the  headers  variable again  because it now contained wrong information from the first request.  I think that behavior is not intuitive  so I think it should be changes. I guess the solution would be cloning the headers object. That would add cost  however since the headers object is not nested  it s actually okay.  Best  Finn ,finnp,closed,1,2014-09-09 22:49:40,2014-09-09 22:50:48,,,,0,1

So  the redirecting request goes to http://74.125.232.67 with Location header  /?search  rather than the google.com/?search.  I propose a fix for that  https://github.com/mikeal/request/pull/1064 .  It only deletes the  host  header if the Location header is a URL in case it is a redirection to another domain. Otherwise  the  host  header is carried between redirects.  It seems to work fine on my case but are there any issues it can create that I can t foresee? ,umutm,closed,7,2014-09-10 15:20:01,2014-09-24 15:20:03,,,,0,1
8675,request/request,1066,Timeout ignored when using Nock,Hi    Not sure this is a Nock or a Request issue. Timeout property of is ignored when using Nock:      js  var options =           method:  POST           url: http://www.google.com          timeout: 100          ...   ;  ...  httpRequest options  function  error  sipsResponse  body           //throw 599 if  ETIMEDOUT    ;      Content of my test:      js nock  http://www.google.com       .post config.sips.orderInitializeUrl      .delay 2000       .reply 504   Timeout in the chain              Content Type :  plain/text         ;      request server.app .post  /myapi       .set  Accept    application/json       .send            test :  test             .expect  Content Type    plain/text       .expect 599   Timeout while calling google   done ;      But when running this  the 504 error is thrown after 2000ms. The expected behavior is that the 599 error  ETIMEOUT  should be thrown by Request.  Any idea why this is happening ? ,bg-o,open,4,2014-09-10 15:23:05,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1
8674,request/request,1067,Alterations to support HTTPS requests in a browser environment when the library is loaded via browserify. ,The changes are minor and they are related to the fact that browserify does not resolve dynamic paths when building client side browser javascript. So  when modules are loaded using the optional   module  they are loaded dynamically  their names are passed in  so browserify can not resolve the dependencies   since the resolution happens before runtime.   This minor fix uses the process package to determine if the environment running the module is in fact the browser  and if it is  we explicitly import modules rather than using the optional flag.  e.g.  https = optional  https    became:  https = process.browser ? require  https   : optional  https    ,nemanjawork,closed,16,2014-09-10 19:28:09,2014-10-16 12:49:54,,,,1,1

8667,request/request,1074,2.42.0 breaks couchapp,I haven t fully debugged why this happens  but it is a regression since 2.34.  I haven t bisected yet.  Couchapp does a GET  then a PUT  and then immediately does a GET afterwards to the same url.  For some reason  this is hanging at the second GET.  I see from the  NODE_DEBUG=request  output that it s getting to  self.httpModule.request ..   call in  start     and then the http module is debug outputting  outgoing message end   but then it just sits there doing nothing.

8663,request/request,1078,The json option does not work anymore.,According to the documentation:  >  json   sets body but to JSON representation of value and adds Content type: application/json header. Additionally  parses the response body as JSON.  This property does not seem to work anymore.  Here is what I experienced:  1  I had an older project where my mikael/request dependency version was just specified as       in package.json 2  Recently I deleted the node_modules folder  did an  npm install  to reinstall all the dependencies  and it pulled in the latest version of request  2.42.0   over the older version that it had before. 3  After the NPM install I noticed that my project was no longer sending JSON bodies with its POST requests as it did before. Instead on the other end of the line the POST requests were coming through with empty bodies. Naturally this broke a lot of things. 4  I was able to get my code working again by changing from using the  json  property to the  body  property.  Example of what I had before which used to work in the older version of request  and which should still work according to the docs:      js     request                  url:  REDACTED           method:  POST           json:             foo:  bar                           function  err  response  body          ;      The above example no longer worked  however changing it to this did work:      js    request                  url:  REDACTED           method:  POST           body:             foo:  bar                           function  err  response  body          ;      In summary it appears that the  json  options longer functions  or has been deprecated.

8648,request/request,1093,Weird issue with POST transactions using 2.44.0,I was slamming my head against the wall for 2 days trying to figure out a very weird issue that started occurring ever since I upgraded to 2.44.0: 1. GET client calls through request to my API work fine 2. Initial POST client calls through request to my API work fine 3. Then after one or two more POST calls using request  the API errors out because the POST payload either doesn t get there at all or only partially gets there and the API has a JSON parse error for the partial JSON message.  I honestly have no idea what is the root cause  but I tried switching back and forth between 2.44.0 and 2.43.0 several times and the issue consistently happens when I am using 2.44.0. Sorry I don t have more info than that  but I can provide any additional information you think would help to debug this. ,jeffwhelpley,open,0,2014-09-23 20:07:07,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

[x] People s  run linters themselves to catch some of the more egregious errors/bugs. Create PRs to fix these. 2. [x] Add a linter to the project s devDependencies. Allow anyone to easily run the linter via npm scripts  npm run lint   3. [x] Create a list of linting rules that A  everyone agrees on   B  pass on our codebase     1.  trivial amount of fixup work allowed to get them to pass. If non trivial amount of work is needed  make the rule more lienient and create an issue to address non trivial work in the future  4. [x] Add linting to npm test. Tests won t pass unless the linter passes 5. [x] Start linting the testing directory  non trivial . Once the directory is in a clean state  add auto linting.  For the project linter  I d like to suggest [eslint] http://eslint.org/ . It s actively developed  and the pluggable rules are perfect for an incremental approach to clean up our  currently  messy code base.

However  if you add a  response  event handler  then you must consume the data from the response object  either by calling response.read   whenever there is a  readable  event  or by adding a  data  handler  or by calling the .resume   method. Until the data is consumed  the  end  event will not fire. Also  until the data is read it will consume memory that can eventually lead to a  process out of memory  error.    It doesn t seem like I need to do anything with body for a post if all I care about is the response.statusCode is 200 or not.  I was wondering how the request package handles the response  if I should be handling this differently or if this is just an intermittent issue with bad connections.  Any help on this would be very appreciated  its not a frequent error  but this post is a critical part of the code I m working on.  Otherwise  this package is working great.

8598,request/request,1143,Rewrite all tests to use tape,As discussed at  1003  migrate tests to use @substack s [ tape ] https://github.com/substack/tape  testing framework which outputs [ tap ] http://testanything.org/ .  This is a massive PR  but I hope it can be reviewed and merged quickly because:   We badly need to move away from the ad hoc testing structure we have now.  In the process of rewriting the tests I found a lot of instances where tests were not being called or were not working as expected.   This will go stale pretty quickly if it s not merged.   It was a lot of work on my end.  For pretty reporting  I m using [ taper ] https://github.com/nylen/taper   a project I found  forked  and fixed up.  It s not perfect  but I couldn t find an existing tap reporter that met my wishlist:   Clean  concise  preferably colored output  with clear indications of where errors occur   Test file timeout support   this is crucial for tape because it s easy to forget to end a test properly  and when this happens they just hang.  You can see what the output looks like:   [when all tests pass] https://travis ci.org/nylen/request/jobs/37699501    [when some of them fail] https://travis ci.org/nylen/request/jobs/37697054 .  This should also help with the intermittent build failures we ve been seeing on Travis.  For example  [this job output] https://travis ci.org/nylen/request/jobs/37698924  gives more clues as to the problem with  test timeout.js .  I also cleaned up any code style issues that stood out to me  so we should be well positioned to start linting the test directory as a next step.  I ll be around to help address any follow up issues. ,nylen,closed,7,2014-10-11 19:00:02,2014-10-11 21:16:58,,,,1,1

8595,request/request,1146, Request.init    Refactor Proposal, I was about to post this in  1094  but decided not to pollute the overall restructuring conversation going on there.   Another thing at the top of my Refactoring Christmas list is to move the user provided request options off of the Request instance itself. Right now everything is thrown onto the request instance  and then some are set with defaults while others are not. This  processing the options  logic is then mixed with the  setting up the request based on options  logic in the  init    method. This makes it hard when reading the code  especially when tracing different request properties through the life of the request.  Here s what I m imagining:      javascript Request = function  options      // set defaults and otherwise process user given options into an expected object format   options = processOptions options ;    // initialize with expected options object   this.init options ;   // set options onto instance for later methods / the public to access   self.options = options;    Request.prototype.init = function  options      // Use the options object itself for everything   if  options.proxy        self.setupTunnel         // etc...        This would reduce the size of the large  init    method  currently at  500 lines  by removing everything not related to the actual request initialization.

8594,request/request,1147,jQuery.ajax   from jsdom using accept encoding: gzip deflate?,I am currently using jsdom xmlhttprequest but am limited in what I can do with accept encoding. I am hoping to receive gzip d response bodies from within jsdom in a jQuery.ajax   call. I am sharing code across browser and server so the advantages of having a pluggable xhr object are huge for me. But it seems as though neither jsdom nor xmlhttprequest are picking up the duties of inflating deflated content. I noticed that with the native zlib node module and request.pipe   it s possible but it looks to me like I would have to modify my code to use straight  .ajax   in the browser but on the server use request.pipe  ? Has anyone else come across and solved this problem? ,thomhickey,open,0,2014-10-13 04:56:33,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

8575,request/request,1166,Remove UNIX Socket URL Validation,In  516   UNIX Socket URL Support  added support for the  unix://  protocol  which allowed developers to make requests locally  like so:  request.get  unix://tmp/unix.socket/httppath     This feature is neat  but it comes at a cost: asynchronous initialization. since that PR  request objects are be created but not fully initialized until nextTick  for the unix case  sometimes even a full second later . This is because request was validating the full unix URI before continuing with initialization. Because it wasn t sure where the path started and the socket began  it would attempt to connect to each different combination until one succeeded.  This is completely unnecessary  bordering on ridiculous. Instead of validating the route  why not just add an option to do:           unix:        path:  /foo/bar        socket:  /absolute/path/to/socket             Regressions:   No longer automatically parse a  unix://  URI  Improvements:   Reduce  init   / request  by 100  lines   Make  init    synchronous again  and removing the half initialized state on construction   Improve performance on  unix://  URIs   Bring  _buildRequest    back into  init     having both is confusing   The best part is  automatic parsing can still be done in a separate module outside of request  so nothing is really lost.

8547,request/request,1194,Tweaks to no_proxy support,I was really hoping this PR would make it so that  npm  would honor  no_proxy : https://github.com/mikeal/request/pull/1096  Unfortunately it doesn t yet  even though  npm@2.1.5  includes  request@2.45.0   which has the PR. It appears a few things need to happen for full  no_proxy  support in npm: 1.  npm  needs to no longer set a proxy setting on request objects. See issue  https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6524 2.  npm request client  should bump to  request@2.45.0 . See issue https://github.com/npm/npm registry client/issues/75 3.  request  needs to be tweaked to support  self.proxy === undefined . See below.  The problem is that none of the no_proxy logic in  request  will be executed if the  self.proxy  property exists  even if the value is  undefined . Here s the current code:      if  self.hasOwnProperty  proxy           This means any consuming packages have to actually delete the proxy property instead of just setting it to  undefined  or  null . You can see this code here: https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/master/request.js L357  Is there a reason to not use  if   self.proxy    ? I d be happy to submit a pull request  but wasn t sure if there was some other reason for using  hasOwnProperty .  I m suggesting this because when the default proxy settings in  npm  are removed   1 above   request objects appear to be created with  proxy=undefined . This causes the no_proxy logic to be skipped. ,tauren,closed,1,2014-10-20 20:32:29,2014-11-10 05:38:12,,,,0,1

8526,request/request,1215,Add proxyHeaderExclusiveList option for proxy only headers.,Fixes  1070 by adding  proxyHeaderExclusiveList  for list of headers that should be sent exclusively to proxy in tunnel mode.

Now any header from  proxyHeaderExclusiveList   incl.  Proxy Authorization   goes through simpler flow: 1  if in tunnel mode  move it from regular  headers  to  proxyHeaders ; 2  that s it :P  So it covers the same flow that  Proxy Authorization  had  and at the same time gives ability to extend list with custom proxy only headers.  Incorporates  1028 and  1050. ,RReverser,closed,8,2014-10-24 22:42:10,2014-10-26 19:09:00,,,,1,1

How can i make those two requests asynchronously using async module. I have tried to use async.parallel however the syntax doesn t play well with request s syntax since async.parallel takes a callback.  2.How can i sort of merge the results ? I need to save them to the database at the same time in the same object in Mongo.  I hope this makes sense.  Thanks  ,harrisrobin,closed,2,2014-10-28 04:39:57,2014-10-28 11:52:56,,,,0,1

8509,request/request,1232,Weird issue with setting and not setting headers option,Hi Guys   I m new to nodejs and I have encountered a weird issue that doesn t make sense to me. This is in relation to the character encoding I m receiving which affects some special characters. Specifically the  content type  in response.headers. Basically if I specify the headers option I will get UTF8 result if not I will get ISO 8859 1. Though the only option I have set in headers is user agent and I haven t specify encoding. See code below:      var headers =        user agent  :  Mozilla/5.0  Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_8  AppleWebKit/537.13   KHTML  like Gecko  Version/5.1.7 Safari/534.57.2      var siteURL =  http://www.google.com.ph   // This one returns result charset as ISO 8859 1 var requestOptions1 =   encoding: null  uri: siteURL   request requestOptions1  function  error  response  body        console.log  Header not set:    response.headers ;   ;  // This one returns result charset as UTF8 var requestOptions2 =   encoding: null  uri: siteURL  headers: headers   request requestOptions2  function  error  response  body        console.log  Header is set:    response.headers ;   ;      The issue here is that the two code renders different results with characters displayed in browser as ?. I have tried with and without iconv lite and it seems correct characters will be shown without iconv lite by just specifying headers in request option  even though setting the headers option not related to encoding fixes the issue. Can someone explain what s happening here?  Thanks guys  ,noej,closed,2,2014-10-29 17:13:43,2014-10-29 18:28:17,,,,0,1

It s not the problem of Node v0.8 itself. So I added  before_install  command to install the latest version of npm before installing the dependencies of request.   This change requires the users of this module to use npm >= 1.4.3. So I updated [ engines ] https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html engines  in package.json and added [ engineStrict ] https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html enginestrict  field.  After merging this PR  we can also merge  1189 without dropping Node v0.8 support. ,shinnn,closed,6,2014-10-30 01:22:33,2014-10-30 14:26:48,,,,1,1

8478,request/request,1264,Can t handle InvalidUri when on streaming mode,When I do a request on streaming mode. That is  i don t pass a callback to the request function  it doesn t seem possible to handle InvalidURI errors.  By code inspection  of the Request.init method  you can see:      javascript   if   self.uri.host    self.uri.protocol  ==  unix:         // Invalid URI: it may generate lot of bad errors  like  TypeError: Cannot call method  indexOf  of undefined  in CookieJar     // Detect and reject it as soon as possible     var faultyUri = url.format self.uri      var message =  Invalid URI      faultyUri           if  Object.keys options .length === 0          // No option ? This can be the sign of a redirect       // As this is a case where the user cannot do anything  they didn t call request directly with this URL        // they should be warned that it can be caused by a redirection  can save some hair        message  =  . This can be caused by a crappy redirection.            // This error was fatal     return self.emit  error   new Error message            The code detects the error and does an emit   of it. But  since this is part of the initialization process  we haven t yet had the possibility to register an on  error   handler. Something like this:      javascript request  a bad uri  .on  error   errorHandler       Our errorHandler won t be registered since the error emision happens before the .on   call. So  the default error handler takes control and it crashes.  The only error handler present at that moment  is the one is set within the Request.init method for the callback sent on the request   call. So this  works ok:      javascript request  a bad uri   callback       The problem is  that if i do this  the response body will be buffered  and that s not desirable in my case.  My diagnosis  might be incorrect  and I might be missing something here  sorry about that. But if I m correct  this problem is also true for every detected error within the  init    method  before the process.nextTick at the end.  A Probable fix would be to delay all error emision to the process.nextTick at the end of init  . I can do that and send the pull request  but i m not sure if it would break something else.

8471,request/request,1271,Stream multipart/related is broken: missing chunked encoding for default  GET  method.,Issue  1185 implemented  multipart/related  stream support even for streams of unknown length. This means using HTTP  Transfer Encoding: chunked  because the other transfer encoding  the default one  requires setting the  Content Length  header beforehand.  HTTP chunked encoding is _not_ implemented in current  request  master: Using wireshark I see that currently neither the  content length  nor the  transfer encoding: chunked  is set. The combined stream is part of the solution  but it needs to be piped to a chunk encoder before sending it to the socket. I don t know what can be done by node.js itself  with its http module .  This means that current multipart/related requests are broken HTTP requests since  request  2.47.0.

8459,request/request,1283,Multipart Improvements,After I changed the behavior of the multipart API in https://github.com/request/request/pull/1185 a few issues popped out because of it: https://github.com/request/request/issues/1243 fixed here https://github.com/request/request/pull/1253  then https://github.com/request/request/issues/1271 fixed here https://github.com/request/request/pull/1276 so I thought we could handle that in a better way.    Detect body streams  This one overrides the rest of the options. In case the user set a stream as the body value  then chunked encoding will be used and all of the data will be piped with combined stream.  The detection for a stream is here https://github.com/simov/request/blob/e74000d7ed82e293e46e7a8bce167eae144873ca/request.js L1442 L1444   no idea if that s a reliable solution   or not  .  Essentially this case will allow existing clients to continue to work without any changes  in other words this fixes the introduced breaking change for CouchDB users and possibly others as well.    Always chunked  By setting the  transfer encoding: chunked   header explicitly you get the expected behavior from it   request will be chunked and body parts will be piped   always  .    Using multipart object options  Having the object option here is good in case we want to add more features to it  or extract this API into a separate module. The  chunked  option here overrides the  transfer encoding: chunked   header  if set   also the detection of body streams is still viable here. ,simov,closed,9,2014-11-22 13:43:52,2014-12-16 16:25:55,,,,1,1
8458,request/request,1284,v2.46.0 can t open as many parallel requests,After upgrading to v2.46.0  I noticed that the request library can t open as many requests in parallel as before. The issue appears to stem from the change in  1168 to change the  process.nextTick  call into a  setImmediate  call. This change seems like it will generally make the request library less aggressive in hogging the event loop  which is probably a good thing  but if you re actually trying to achieve high levels of request concurrency  it seems to prevent that. Now  despite the lower concurrency  there isn t a huge performance difference between the approaches  although it does seem like the library is marginally slower when using  setImmediate  with a bunch of parallel requests.  My use case might not be very common  but why I care about the request concurrency is that I m using the request library inside an integration test that performs parallel requests against a server. The test is trying to check rate limits and concurrency limits on the HTTP server  so this is why I noticed the reduced concurrency  since the tests are no longer able to achieve the levels of concurrency we re trying to test .  I m not sure what the best solution is here  but would there be any interest in a pull request to make this configurable  so you could pick whether you wanted to use  setImmediate  or  process.nextTick  for the  defer  behavior ? Because it seems like  setImmediate  might be the right call in most cases  but if you re actually trying to achieve higher levels of concurrency  then it seems like you have to use  process.nextTick . Or is there maybe some other way I m missing to achieve high concurrency levels with  setImmediate ?  I ve put together a little example of a server and client to demonstrate the changes in behavior caused by this between v2.45.0 and v2.46.0:    server.js        js var http = require  http  ; var server = http.createServer function req  res      res.writeHead 200     Content Type :  text/plain    ;   res.end  Hello World n  ;   ; server.listen 8099   127.0.0.1  ;  var openConnections = 0; var maxOpenConnections = 0; server.on  connection   function socket      openConnections  ;   if openConnections > maxOpenConnections        maxOpenConnections = openConnections;        socket.on  close   function         openConnections  ;     ;   ;  setInterval function       console.info  maxOpenConnections:     maxOpenConnections ;    1000 ;        client.js        js var async = require  async        request = require  request  ;  var options =     pool:       maxSockets: 500        ;  var start = Date.now   async.times 250  function index  callback      request.get  http://127.0.0.1:8099/   options  function error  response        callback error ;     ;    function       console.info  Finished. Took:      Date.now     start     ms  ;   ;      Steps to reproduce:   Run the server.js file. This server just keeps track of the maximum number of concurrent open connections and prints it out every second.   While the server is running as a separate process  run the client.js. This attempts to open 250 parallel requests to the server and prints how long it took to execute all of them.  Prior to  1168:   The server reports  maxOpenConnections: 250  meaning that all 250 of the parallel requests were at least connected to the server at one time.   On 3 test runs  the client reports execution times of 210ms  214ms  and 212ms  After  1168:   The server reports  maxOpenConnections: 17  meaning at no point were more than 17 concurrent connections actually established to the server.   On 3 test runs  the client reports execution times of 232ms  233ms  and 236ms ,GUI,open,2,2014-11-22 18:12:01,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

8442,request/request,1300,Retry on ECONNRESET,I m working on a [PR] https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/3015  for PouchDB to enable PouchDB in node.js to make replication GET requests in parallel. But in testing this code under duress with a pool of 15 connections I inevitably run into a situation where one of the connections fails with a ECONNRESET. This then causes request.js to throw a failure and ends up causing all of PouchDB to quit.  At first I thought this was because I wasn t using the forever agent  whose existence I knew nothing of and learned about by accident . Eventually I passed in  forever : true  and confirmed that the forever agent is being used. But that didn t fix things. I was still failing occasionally on ECONNRESET.  I did find [the code] https://github.com/request/request/blob/ce705147036b57e5b4c91d2f0ff7b48c7512b561/request.js L960  that handles this error but it depends on _reusedSocket which is always undefined in my tests and so the test always fails.  Question 1   should the _reusedSocket test be removed?  Question 2   Even if the answer to question 1 is  yes  it seems like the retry logic is more than a little fragile in these cases  there would be exactly one retry and no way to configure more . Is the intent that one is required to use something like [node request retry] https://github.com/FGRibreau/node request retry ?  Question 3   Why does node request retry need to exist? Isn t this the sort of functionality that should be in request? Or is there some line in the sand that says these are separate issues? Sorry if this is a silly question but I m new to all of this.

Last time it broke it was because one of the dependencies had a dependency which in turn used  fs.readFile   which obviously does not work well in browsers. But those things are hard to spot unless it is automated.  So to sum it up. This is not for testing that all features actually work in the browser. Just to make sure it will bundle nicely.  One negative thing about this is the added dependencies and the added test build time. In addition to having more tests to  support  of course. For me the positive effects outshines this  but I can understand if someone might make that argument.  Anyway  this is the first take. Open for discussion  of course.

I know that this is because of  http Agent  create sockets with keep alive  enabled. WIth  require  pool:false     which effectively set  agent = false  for underlying  http.request  can eliminate this problem.  But I want to take the benefit of connection pool while keep the amount of them under control.   I tried with 3rd party agents  e.g.  agentkeepalive  and  keep alive agent  with  request  agent: 3rd_party_agent    which work with raw  http.request   but no luck with  request . I saw the amount of  TIME_WAIT  connection growing with such combination.  My question is that  how can I properly apply pool  agent  implementations to  Request  so that I can both limit my connections in a reasonable amount and enjoy the advantages of pools? ,dg3feiko,open,4,2014-12-24 09:25:20,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

8408,request/request,1334,Wrong encoding for basic authentication,The _request_ module provides an option to authenticate requests via basic authentication. The method wich is applied to encode the user credentials is described in RFC2617 https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt   It states:      To receive authorization  the client sends the userid and password     separated by a single colon   :   character  within a base64 [7]    encoded string in the credentials.        basic credentials = base64 user pass       base64 user pass  = <base64 [4] encoding of user pass       But the RFC doesn t state the encoding which has to be applied before the strings get converted to base64. The _request_ module in it s current implementation uses _ASCII_ encoding  https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/lib/helpers.js L77 . This leads to wrong base64 encodings when it s getting towards string which are only defined in ISO 8859 1 or even UTF 8  The problem is discussed over here in detail  with the result that ISO 8859 1 instead of ASCII or UTF 8 should be used for the encoding http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7242316/what encoding should i use for http basic authentication ,sbrinkmann,open,7,2015-01-06 07:42:18,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

This change will pass the error up to request so users can act on the  error  event  in my case I d retry the request. The only impact this should have on existing applications is they emit error events more often if the application uses form data instead of ignoring it.   The alternative option would be to in the application would be to listen to the  error  event on the form object created from request.form   which I m happy to do but I thought since it s used by request it d be good if it could be sent to the callback.

Mostly it works but I have issues when working on  localhost  or  127.0.0.1  or basically anything where I need to ignore the proxy for development purposes   otherwise proxy will map my http requests to corporate urls.  I set as required all the following env variables:   HTTPS_PROXY    HTTP_PROXY    NO_PROXY    https_proxy    http_proxy  and  no_proxy .  However  when making calls using the  request  library it doesn t work.  We instantiate the request library using our own wrapper library that does the following:      var defaultOptions = _getDefaultOptions  ; this.request = request.defaults defaultOptions ;      Where  _getDefaultOptions    is as follows:      function _getDefaultOptions         var options =   ;      _checkProxies options ;     _checkCertificates          [ /etc/pki/certificate.pem ]          options      ;      if   options.cert            var defaultClientCertificatePair =               certLocation:  /etc/pki/tls/certs/client.crt               keyLocation:  /etc/pki/tls/private/client.key           ;         _checkCertificateKeyPair [defaultClientCertificatePair]  options ;            options.rejectUnauthorized = false;      return options;        Further debugging revealed that the issue is because the method  getProxyFromUri  is never entered  https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/request.js L170   This is because the block  https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/request.js L427        if  self.hasOwnProperty  proxy         self.proxy = getProxyFromURI self.uri         To invoke the above method is never entered is set.

8382,request/request,1360,Refactor basic  bearer  digest auth logic into separate class,  WIP    I moved the  auth  method logic into separate file. The  auth  method is split into two methods  basic  and  bearer . Also I moved  _digest  and the part of the code in  onRequestResponse  related to these 3 methods.  The reasons to move exactly these functions is as follows: all private flags  _hasAuth    _sentAuth  and private variables  _bearer   _user    _pass  are local for the  Auth  class. That way  request  now knows only about only 3 distinct methods  _auth.basic    _auth.bearer  and  _auth.response  versus 6 variables  _hasAuth    _sentAuth    _bearer    _user    _pass  and  _digest   The  Auth  class keeps a pointer to the  request  instance  but only use it to modify the headers  as well as reading some values  as I said private variables related to the  Auth  class are not set in  request    Other than that the code is mostly copy/pasted without changes  it certainly can be improved but I wanted to make this PR as short as possible. Also the  debug  call is currently commented out.  Ping @nylen @seanstrom @FredKSchott  ,simov,closed,15,2015-01-17 21:41:32,2015-01-21 18:46:57,,,,1,1

8376,request/request,1366,Refactor OAuth into separate module,This is a follow up to my previous PR https://github.com/request/request/pull/1350 Also it might be related to this one https://github.com/request/request/pull/1360  The  getParams  function is about the generation of OAuth parameters. I think it s pretty straightforward to understand which parameters have defaults  which are excluded  and what parameters are required for the OAuth signature.  The  concatParams  function is the old  buildSortedParams  but I though it deserves it s own function  I mean the  oa  parameter was used from the outer scope  so it was not exactly a function in that sense.  One change in  concatParams  is that the signature is no longer appended to the end of the string  but that can be changed if it not confront to the spec in some way.  The  oauth  function is pretty much what s left from the original one  but I think now it s more compact and easy to follow  it even fits on my screen. The  getParams  and  concatParams  are called from there  there is only one level of indirection so again it s very easy to follow.  All of the available input  args  parameters are listed on top of the  oauth  function. Also right now in Request this module is called like  var result = oauth.oauth  which is a bit silly  but I couldn t come up with something more reasonable.  At first I thought that returning of a map is not a good idea for the  oauth  method  but then I liked how it feels  I mean  result.transport  and  result.oauth  sounds good to me.  That s all I could think of at the moment. ,simov,closed,14,2015-01-22 12:58:33,2015-01-27 13:26:59,,,,1,1

This PR does the following:   Modifies the scripts in package.json to not compile with browserify directly.   Modifies the clean script to delete the coverage folder  not sure if this is preferred over adding it to . ignore    Add some new dependencies.   Make sure karma does both coverage and browserify.

8356,request/request,1386,Make more browser tests,Hey.  As mentioned in  1376 I started seeing if I could write a more extensive browser test suite. So first things first  we now have coverage info  via that issue .  So next thing I started doing was just copying some tests from the  server side test suite   and noticed a couple of things. I am going to use test toJSON as an example  since it is fairly small and easy.      Tests are starting servers  This is an obvious one. And why shouldn t tests start servers  right? The thing is that I can make all assertions in test toJSON pass  if I only execute the parts that does not open or close the server.  So my question is: Wouldn t the ideal thing here be to share the test cases? Not sure what the ideal model would be  but for example this would work:      js  use strict   var request = require  ../index       http = require  http       tape = require  tape    var s = http.createServer function  req  resp      resp.statusCode = 200   resp.end  asdf       tape  setup   function t      s.listen 6767  function         t.end            require  ./common/test toJSON   tape  request ;  tape  cleanup   function t      s.close function         t.end                ...or something like that.  The other alternative is to duplicate the tests that are actually relevant for the browser. Which of course is not every test anyway.      Starting servers for the browser.  My next question is. Some of the tests will not work via CORS. For example are you not allowed to read all the same headers when the request is cross domain. Luckily karma has a built in proxy  so you can actually get /basic to go to a server with basic auth  for example . What is our best course of action here? Should we try to reuse the servers in the tests also? Should we add some routing to the one server  and make it serve what we need for the tests we need?  ...or should we just be pragmatic and toss in whatever we can make pass into the tests/browser directory?   And final question: one PR per test suite? A PR now and then with a couple of tests suites?  Thoughts? ,eiriksm,open,2,2015-01-29 16:40:24,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

The  related  method just wraps them up  but that logic can be put somewhere else.

I even allow the  setHeaders  method to modify the instance  so I contradict myself here  I know  but it seemed more logical in this case.  Other than that I really want to see a few more modules out of request before I can decide on the best approach about the instance.

If the response is a file  it will be missing a few bytes from the beginning.      javascript var requestObject = request ...  // need to pause here requestObject.pause   requestObject.on  response   function  resp      if resp.statusCode===200       requestObject.pipe somewhere     else      //retry...       ;      pausing  requestObject  saves the day  but it doesn t get resumed when you call  requestObject.pipe  and has to be resumed manually.  Now the other way:  if I pass an option:      javascript formData:    file: stream        All s well  request is sent  but no content type and filename set. So I go on and do:      javascript formData:    file:       value:stream      options:        filename:  whatever   //silently required  see https://github.com/felixge/node form data/issues/74       contentType:  text/xml                   If  stream  is a plain string  all works well. If  stream  is a new node 0.10 stream  it hangs forever.  Seems serious to me.  This bug could be split in two if the first case can be fixed without intervention in  form data . In that case  let me know how I could help and where to start looking if I want to make a PR.  PS. I wrote the code in github textbox and tried to make indents with tab and space so it got submitted too early. ,naugtur,open,4,2015-02-03 16:03:11,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

8336,request/request,1406,Refactor redirect logic into separate module,In the last few days I have the idea that the request plugins should introduce  onRequest  and  onResponse  hooks at minimum. Also all of them should be classes that caches the  request  instance internally.  Then in  base  we should have defaults like:      js function Auth         Auth.prototype.onRequest = function  options      // just nothing  or throw some error accordingly   Auth.prototype.onResponse = function  response      // just nothing  or throw some error accordingly    function Redirect         Redirect.prototype.onRequest = function  options      // just nothing  or throw some error accordingly   Redirect.prototype.onResponse = function  response      // just nothing  or throw some error accordingly        and so on  The idea is that request  base  should work without having certain plugins included. Essentially all plugins should modify the request instance on their own.  Then we can configure the plugins like this:      js var request = require  request    // just like the defaults method var custom = request.config [ auth    redirect    streams ]       Obviously with this approach we should have the hooks defined internally  in other words this does not allow for user made plugins. The reason why is that certain plugin hooks should be called in specific parts of the code  like for example the  auth  response hook called inside the  redirect  plugin  but that may change   My initial idea was to just loop through all plugins required by the config method  inside the  init  and  onRequestResponse  methods  so we can think about these plugins as middlewares that are used or not. I guess that would be possible at some point  and this will allow just about any custom made plugin/middleware to be called for each request/response pair  and modify the state accordingly.  Let me know what do you think :  ,simov,closed,2,2015-02-05 10:31:28,2015-02-11 01:07:14,,,,1,1

8308,request/request,1434,Is it possible to proxy a request with multipart/formdata and add Digest auth?,I d like to add authentication to a proxied multipart/formdata request. The following one line proxy code works for Basic authentication but not for Digest  I m guessing because Digest requires an additional request :      js function submit req  res  next       var submissionUrl =  https://some.thirdparty.com/submission ;     var submissionRequest = request  submissionUrl  .auth  username    password   false ;      req.pipe  submissionRequest  .pipe  res  ;        Is there a way to pipe the request and add Digest authentication? My main goal is to avoid a solution that requires parsing the request body and re adding the form data to a new request. ,MartijnR,closed,6,2015-02-17 22:45:22,2015-02-18 22:52:00,,,,0,1

8301,request/request,1441,Should have possibility to set global defaults,Fe. having to be able to force timout globally  ie. anyone who just requires request will get it with that default setting  would be greatly appreciated. Just had an issue where requests didn t have timeouts and they started piling up on the internal API load balancer  which then caused other issues.  In order to have correct settings set  having to call defaults with correct optiosn every time you use request is a bit on the dangerous side  especially on diverse teams.  On app.js  just being able to call something like...      js require  request  .globalDefaults     timeout: 10 1000   ;      ...could be hugely beneficial. Or even setting custom headers etc.  In this case  I ended up fixing the issue by duckpunching  .get    .post  etc. shorthand methods with logic that adds timeout to the requests. Not a pretty solution but works for now. ,mikkotikkanen,closed,2,2015-02-20 11:31:22,2015-02-23 00:54:17,,,,0,1

8292,request/request,1450,Implement progress events,It would be nice to have  optional  progress events that would fire for progress  against content length if available  on the raw entity body.  There are 2 libraries that do progress events for request  [request progress] https://www.npmjs.com/package/request progress  and [progress stream] https://www.npmjs.com/package/progress stream .  However both of them fail when you use  gzip: true .  Content Length  describes the length of the entity body  compressed  but both of these libraries only have access to the inflated  uncompressed  stream request gives out.  It doesn t seem possible for these libraries to dig themselves into request s internals to access the raw stream and watch the data that streams through it. So support for progress events looks like something that can only be implemented correctly from within request. ,dantman,open,10,2015-02-25 09:38:19,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

There s a built in method for this in the node core: http://nodejs.org/api/http.html http_request_abort  The above method triggers an error event on the request which I don t like. If an error event can be avoided I d prefer it.  I haven t been able to find a similar abort method in request. Is this something that already exists or would you be interested in implementing something like this?  My use case for this is to abort a request to a long poll endpoint  add more data to the request  and then establish a long poll again. ,ErikOrjehag,open,5,2015-03-04 11:09:16,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

8251,request/request,1491,https proxy fails with ECONNRESET  and  unknown header     ,Hi   I ve been trying to install tnode sass on my machine and I keep hitting problems with my proxy server. I ve raised the issue sass/node sass 768  and it appears that this may be an issue with request  or a misuse of request.  Anyway  here is the case:   I ve got a proxy  cntlm  that can be accessed through both HTTP and HTTPS. When I specify the proxy url using  http:  things work as expected. When I specify the proxy url using  https:  nothing works at all.  Basically  whenever I use  https  as proxy url I get the same root cause for the error: The script returns an  ECONNRESET  error  with no more information about what was wrong   and the proxy debug logs show the following:              Round 1 C: 21         Reading headers  21 ... HEAD:  headers_recv: Unknown header    . headers_recv: fd 21 error  4 Joining thread 140418809730816; rc: 0      This error message seems to indicate that the headers part of the request contains a     character that the proxy does not understand. It also seems that this     character is not followed by a line break.  The same thing happens whether I set  tunnel  to  true  or  false .  The  options  object passed to request is the following:      javascript      rejectUnauthorized: false    proxy:  https://127.0.0.1:3129     tunnel: true    ca: null    strictSSL: false         Note that in my situation  I don t have many possible workarounds  such as setting the proxy URL to http  because the script must run without extra configuration on all the computers of my organization  which has a very heterogenous setup. ,npiguet,open,1,2015-03-18 10:31:16,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

8249,request/request,1493,Support/refactor init method,Hello everybody   it s been a while since I ve submitted a refactoring PR  and this time I decided to try to break up and clean the logic that s happening in the Request.prototype.init function. At the moment I ve refactored a bunch of code into some well meaning functions. I also leveraged the  constructObject  function heavily  I do notice that s not necessary in every place I use it  but the I do feel that it s useful in most of the areas.  The biggest difference is that the init logic has been moved to another module. This is more of a temporary refactor  there was just to much logic polluting the request.js file. Another big difference is the way I m doing some error handling  you ll see what I mean  but just know I m not completely set on that implementation.  Overall this is still a work in progress  but I would like to hear some feedback.  Summoning: @simov @nylen @FredKSchott @mikeal  ,seanstrom,closed,32,2015-03-19 04:29:37,2015-05-13 11:32:13,,,,1,1

8244,request/request,1498,Add table of contents in readme,  Add table of contents in readme   Add back to top links at the end of each section   Add horizontal line divider after each section   Add visual cues in options list  Closes https://github.com/request/request/issues/1340 Also related to https://github.com/request/request/pull/1331  Basically I refactored the readme according to what @nylen outlined in https://github.com/request/request/issues/1340 issuecomment 69367275 as collaborative effort to improve the readme.  Easier to review the this PR would be to just check out the rendered markdown file https://github.com/simov/request/tree/refactor readme  Table of contents and back to top links at the end of each section are pretty self explanatory. The horizontal line divider between the sections is mostly for easier maintenance of the file  if you have good markdown syntax highlighting you ll now what I mean  Also I m putting 2 blank lines before and after each horizontal rule  and two blank lines before each header  not an actual rule  just fyi   The last thing was to use simple horizontal lines again  this time for the list of options.  Now if you take a look at it  you ll notice that it s a bit easier to fix your sight on certain things. So the presentation remains linear  no additional headers or text  yet just enough to scan through it faster.  I also wanted to split the sections into separate files and put them under docs folder. But I couldn t figure out a good way to introduce the building process to the user while having the combined readme all the time too.  /cc @rockbot @nylen @FredKSchott and anyone else ,simov,closed,6,2015-03-21 10:23:03,2015-03-21 23:18:01,,,,1,1

8231,request/request,1511,forever not playing nicely with pool in node 0.12,It seems like the  forever  option isn t documented  anymore?  so I m not sure how intended this behavior is  or if it s the result of using a deprecated feature.  We ve used the  forever: true  alongside  pool:  maxSockets: 1024   in the past. This has worked well  but recently we ve found that it throws an error in node 0.12.  Here s a failing test I wrote for that: https://github.com/faradayio/request/commit/abe8b55  It s possible that since both  pool  and  forever  affect the agent  they were never intended to be compatible with each other  maybe. We ll be moving to  request.forever  maxSockets: 1024   .  Should request throw a warning if the user tries to combine these options? Are they supposed to work together?  Here s the error that occurs when I try to combine them in 0.12:      TypeError: Cannot read property  length  of undefined     at ForeverAgent.<anonymous>  /redacted/request/node_modules/forever agent/index.js:22:34      at ForeverAgent.emit  events.js:110:17      at Socket.onFree  _http_agent.js:202:10      at Socket.emit  events.js:104:17      at _http_client.js:453:14     at process._tickCallback  node.js:355:11      ,madd512,closed,9,2015-03-26 17:23:37,2015-04-07 17:09:05,,,,0,1
8230,request/request,1512,Question: returning the underlying native request?,Hi folks   I maintain [a module] https://github.com/thingdom/node neo4j  that builds on Request. To date  the module has entirely abstracted Request away; it takes care of making all requests and parsing all responses.  I d like to add an API that lets callers stream request   response data directly  but it d be nice to still maintain that abstraction/encapsulation of which lib I m using internally.  To that end  I thought maybe this new API could return the underlying native [ http.ClientRequest ] https://nodejs.org/api/http.html http_class_http_clientrequest   so after some investigation  I gave it a stab with Request [like so] https://github.com/thingdom/node neo4j/blob/4866366e8bc3da211e3ec72a02e5de3c559d083b/lib new/GraphDatabase.coffee L67 L72 :      js var req = Request  / ... /  ;  // Instead of leaking our  third party  Request instance  make sure to // explicitly return only its internal native ClientRequest instance. // https://github.com/request/request/blob/v2.53.1/request.js L904 // This is only populated when the request is  start ed  so  start  it  req.start  ; return req.req;         This  works ... but not really.  E.g. there s a race condition if you  pipe  anything to the native request: the Request wrapper no longer [ knows  about the pipe] https://github.com/request/request/blob/v2.53.1/request.js L618   so it may [ end  the request early] https://github.com/request/request/blob/v2.53.1/request.js L676   leading to a  write after end  error .   FWIW  this same race condition exists with Request proper  if you stream request data yourself manually via async  write  calls  rather than  pipe . But I m sure that s an uncommon use case.   In general  I also worry about other bugs: Request is expecting to manage the request and response  and it no longer will.  I could simply create the native request directly  via [ http.request ] https://nodejs.org/api/http.html http_http_request_options_callback   but it s nice to have the extra features that Request provides  e.g. proxy support.  So perhaps the answer is to simply return the full Request instance directly. But then the caller has to look at another API  and also depend on the particular version that my module is using  etc.     All of this is to say: is there any recommended/supported way of working with the underlying native request directly? Or is that explicitly discouraged? Any other suggestions?  Thanks  ,aseemk,open,0,2015-03-26 20:58:08,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

8222,request/request,1520,Refactor defaults,This is a follow up to https://github.com/request/request/pull/1518  Much more simplified defaults and params initialization in index.js. Basically flattened the logic  also moved the  wrap  closure outside of the  defaults  method and I left it in index.js because I think it s very closely related to the  request  method  and the convenience http verb methods. Also completely dropped all of the object extend closures  as I don t think they add any substantial value to that piece of code.  /cc @nylen @FredKSchott @mikeal  ,simov,closed,2,2015-03-30 14:11:47,2015-04-05 04:16:49,,,,1,1

8218,request/request,1524,False positive on NO_PROXY parsing can lead to not able to connect,I ve hit this issue which is very similar  if not the same  as  1294. It happened to me on 2.54.0 and 2.48.0 but strangely  2.49.0 was a version which seems to work properly.  As mentioned in  1294 in my case the NO_PROXY contained a host which was exactly 1 character longer than my actual destination host  which should have been accessed through the PROXY . It was however tried to connect directly  which resulted to no connection.  My suspicion is that this is related to some refactoring like https://github.com/request/request/commit/b205b73960b40a1edaa24f4ccede9b676c07cbf2 change but that s only a guess. ,cthulu,open,2,2015-04-02 08:17:30,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

8200,request/request,1542,clarify confusing timeout note,In the README  the documentation for  timeout  states:  > _timeout_   Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for a request to respond before aborting the request. Note that if the underlying TCP connection cannot be established  the OS wide TCP connection timeout will overrule the timeout option  the default in Linux is around 20 seconds .  I am confused by this. I assume that this note is supposed to refer to the  socket.connect    call timing out. http://linux.die.net/man/2/connect  However  in my testing it appears that  request  sets the timeout on the socket before the  connect    call  so it times out via the integer setting.      javascript var request;  request = require  request  ;  request.get     uri:  http://10.0.0.7     timeout: 3000    function err  res      console.log err ;   console.log res ;   ;      I also tried with  google.com:81 . Both timed out after 3 seconds  which is definitely not the system timeout  nothing in my  /etc/resolv.conf    and removing the timeout parameter means the queries hang for much longer. ,kevinburkeshyp,open,1,2015-04-13 20:53:26,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

Most clients  browsers  cURL  PHP  RubyGem::RestClient  all web browsers  do this. Some actually initiate a connection to   all   IPs and continue the request with whichever connected fastest.  _Request_  and indeed Node native http client  do not appear to do this; they just give up after the first failure.

8183,request/request,1559,How do I set a socket timeout without setting a request lifetime timeout?,When I set the timeout option  I notice that the timeout can trigger before the the socket is opened. Looking at the code  it looks like a  setTimeout  is used before the request is opened. This is a problem for a project of mine since I want to launch concurrent requests but only apply a timeout to the opened socket and not to the entire lifetime of the request  e.g.  I don t want to time out waiting for a connection in the connection pool to become available . How can I set a timeout on the socket without enforcing a timeout on the entire request lifetime? ,jeffcharles,open,1,2015-05-01 22:10:21,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

8180,request/request,1562,Cannot issue HEAD request with a body,request prevents sending a HEAD request with a body. I think this is too strict.   It is only the _response_ to a HEAD request that must not include a body. The HEAD request itself may include a body  cf. [RFC 7231 section 4.3.2] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 section 4.3.2  :  >  A payload within a HEAD request message has no defined semantics; >    sending a payload body on a HEAD request might cause some existing >    implementations to reject the request.  In other words  you can send HEAD with a body  but you might run into trouble.  The same is true for [GET] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 section 4.3.1  and [DELETE] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 section 4.3.5 :  > A payload within a GET request message has no defined semantics; >    sending a payload body on a GET request might cause some existing >    implementations to reject the request. >  >  A payload within a DELETE request message has no defined semantics; >    sending a payload body on a DELETE request might cause some existing >    implementations to reject the request.  Since request allows GET and DELETE with a body  I think it should allow HEAD with a body as well. ,adamjcooper,open,3,2015-05-05 17:39:05,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

I m getting a weird issue when piping a chunked data from HTTP to a file in OS X.  When triggering the GET HTTP request that initiates the download  my server responds with the following headers:      < content disposition: attachment; filename= resin Rpi2 0.1.0 0.0.12.img  < content encoding: gzip < content type: application/octet stream < date: Wed  06 May 2015 19:03:33 GMT < X Frame Options: DENY < x powered by: Express < transfer encoding: chunked < Connection: keep alive      My code goes like this:      fs = require  fs   request = require  request      If you want to try it by yourself  register to https://dashboard.resin.io   create a Raspberry Pi application  note the id on the url    and get the token from the preferences page. APPID =  ...  TOKEN =  ...  DEST =  imagetest.img   request   url:  https://dashboard.resin.io/download?network=ethernet wifiSsid= wifiKey= appId=  APPID     method:  GET    gzip: true   headers:       Authorization:  Bearer   TOKEN    .on  data    data   >   console.log data   .pipe fs.createWriteStream DEST        If I run that script  I correctly get the initial chunks  corresponding to about 10MB of data  but the connection then suddenly ends  and no other event  close  end  etc  is triggered from any of the streams.  What s even more weird is that commenting out  gzip: true  leads to the desired behaviour  I of course get a  .img.gz file in that case   and it also works as expected if keeping the  gzip: true  and piping to  process.stdout  instead of to a file.  Also notice the issue is not reproducible on Ubuntu. It only seems to happen in OS X and Windows.   cURL  also works as expected:        curl  H  Authorization: Bearer [token]   https://dashboard.resin.io/download?network=ethernet wifiSsid= wifiKey= appId=[appid]   o image.img      I ve proceeded to analyse the packet communication  [you can get the pcap here] http://filebin.net/5h4k576f6t/ResinImageDownloadIssue.pcap  :  I can see my IP is suddenly sending a ACK/FIN while the server is still sending me chunks:      Id = 2984 Source = 192.168.0.16 Destination = 52.4.102.97 Captured Length = 66 Packet Length = 66 Protocol = TCP Date Received = 2015 05 06 18:11:36  0000 Time Delta = 10.27246999740601 Information = 52264  > 443  [ACK  FIN]  Seq=2137874087  Ack=3255859962  Win=10407       Followed by a long loop of RST and ACK:      ... 192.168.0.16  > 52.4.102.97  52264  > 443 RST 52.4.102.97  > 192.168.0.16  443  > 52264 ACK ...      And finally an agreed ACK  FIN from both sides.  After a lot of experimentation  the issue is gone if I write the chunks to the destination stream manually instead of piping:      destination = fs.createWriteStream DEST   request   url:  https://dashboard.resin.io/download?network=ethernet wifiSsid= wifiKey= appId=  APPID     method:  GET    gzip: true   headers:       Authorization:  Bearer   TOKEN    .on  data    data   >   destination.write data      ,jviotti,closed,8,2015-05-07 13:15:06,2015-05-08 12:16:50,,,,0,1
8174,request/request,1568,Fix stall when piping gzipped response,When the response content is piped through additional streams for decoding  e.g. for gzip decompression   pause and resume calls should be propagated to the last stream in the pipeline so that back pressure propagates correctly.  This avoids an issue where simultaneous back pressure from the content decoding stream and from a stream to which Request is piped could cause the response stream to get stuck waiting for a drain event on the content decoding stream which never occurs.  See  1567 for an example.  This commit also renames  dataStream  to  responseContent  to remedy my previous poor choice of name  since the name will be exposed on the Request instance it should be clearer and closer to the name used to refer to this data in the relevant RFCs.

8173,request/request,1569,Fix pause before response arrives,This PR fixes a bit of fallout due to overlooking the pause behavior before the response arrives in  1568 last night.  I added some additional tests which should help catch similar issues in the future.    If anyone has ideas for how to avoid the arbitrary  setTimeout s when testing  pause / resume   that would be great  currently it waits a bit between sending chunks to allow pausing and waits a bit more after calling  pause  to confirm no more data arrives .  Also  if there is a better location for the tests  I m open to moving them around too.  Due to  1568  we now propagate pause and resume to the response content stream  rather than the response stream.  However  when pause is called before the response arrives  the pause is still being applied to the response object directly.  Fix this by applying it to the response content stream in both cases.  This avoids the issue that if pause is called on a gzip request before the response arrives  it pauses the response then resumes the response content  meaning the response can not be resumed.  Also add tests of the pause/resume behavior for both the gzip and non gzip case both before and after the response has arrived.  This commit also makes the ancillary change that resume is now called unconditionally  when defined  in  Redirect   since we always want to dump the response data  and it was previously called unconditionally in  onRequestResponse  . ,kevinoid,closed,2,2015-05-08 22:29:38,2015-05-11 16:33:49,,,,1,1

8159,request/request,1583,Error: custom CA behind corporate proxy,Hello all and congratulations for this awesome library .  I ve been experiencing some issues passing custom CA certificates to request. I followed the documentation  setting  agentOptions.ca  successfully in an non proxy environment  but then I moved the code to a proxied one  proxy configured via   http_proxy    and found that it didn t work any more. Te error that returned the previously working code was that it couldn t verify the CA. After some debugging and code inspection I ve summed up the following:  1. using  options.agentOptions.ca   which is the way stated in the documentation  will work in a non proxied env  but not in a proxied one. 2. using  https.globalAgent.options.ca   which is not documented  but is stated in many places  stackoverflow  forums...  as a feasible way of setting it  will work on non proxied but won t in proxied again. 3. using  options.ca   which is not documented  I had to find it inspecting code and later in some issue comments in github  WORKS IN BOTH  non proxied and proxied environments.  The problem lies in this piece of code  or so I think       javascript function constructTunnelOptions request      var proxy = request.proxy    var tunnelOptions =       proxy :         host      : proxy.hostname        port      :  proxy.port        proxyAuth : proxy.auth        headers   : request.proxyHeaders            headers            : request.headers      ca                 : request.ca      cert               : request.cert      key                : request.key      passphrase         : request.passphrase      pfx                : request.pfx      ciphers            : request.ciphers      rejectUnauthorized : request.rejectUnauthorized      secureOptions      : request.secureOptions      secureProtocol     : request.secureProtocol        return tunnelOptions        In order to account for other possibles sources of CA information  this code should become something like:      javascript var tunnelOptions =   //...     ca                 : request.ca     agentOptions.ca    https.globalAgent.options.ca //...        This should take the right order of priority for CAs  request > agentOptions > globalAgent . There s a problem  though:  agentOptions  is not accessible from  constructTunnelOptions . Other alternative could be to use  request.agent    agentOptions  are used to construct that  .agent   but then again   request.agent  is constructed way after  constructTunnelOptions  is called  thus no luck there neither.  One point worth to be discussed  then  is if it s  sane  or semantically correct to set the CA in  agentOptions while in a proxied environment  as there s going to be no agent involved in the communication  it instead uses a tunneled TLS connection   and that s tat. But I also find that  as request tries  and   THANK YOU FOR THAT    to hide the proxy configuration from the developer  it should maintain coherence in the settings among proxied and non proxied environments.    CONCLUSION:   I think the best way to solve this issue is also the simplest: document  options.ca  as the right way of setting the CAs for request  as  agentOptions.ca  would leave uncovered proxied environments  as it has to be  .

8142,request/request,1600,Extract the querystring logic into separate module:,  Update  qs  to version 3.0.0 with support for rfc3986 encoding   Use request s rfc3986 only when using the  querystring  module   Add test branch for rfc3986 encoding tests using  querystring    Support for  eq    sep  and  options  arguments for  querystring     parse  and  stringify  methods via option keys  I was waiting for this PR https://github.com/hapijs/qs/pull/76 to get in to refactor the  rfc3986  logic in request. Then this bug report https://github.com/request/request/issues/1593 came out  so this PR is fixing both issues.  At first I tried using  querystring.escape  for rfc3986 encoding in  querystring.stringify       js this.lib.escape = function  str   return this.rfc3986 str  .bind this       But that would affect the global namespace so I opted out for standard wrapping.  Next I had to export the  querystring.unescape  out of the Querystring module      js Querystring.prototype.unescape = querystring.unescape      because it s used in two places in request.js Quick check on the node s code revealed this:      js QueryString.unescape = function s  decodeSpaces      try       return decodeURIComponent s ;     catch  e        return QueryString.unescapeBuffer s  decodeSpaces .toString  ;      ;      So probably we can use directly  decodeURIComponent  in our context  but then again I chose the safer option.  @limbo lab now you can pass the  sep    eq  and  options  arguments to the  querystring  module like this:      js qsStringifyOptions: sep: ;   eq: :   options: ...

8138,request/request,1604,Thoughts on a cache wrapper,Hi   I m been thinking about creating  yet another  cache wrapper around  request . Before jumping into coding something  I would really appreciate some thoughts from you on this as I m guessing you have done some thinking around caching more than once over the years.  In comparison to the other caching modules I have found so far  I want to do a slightly different approach by literally wrapping instead of being a drop in replacement. Somewhat inspired by the wrapping/interceptors done in the [rest] https://github.com/cujojs/rest  module.      js // something similar to var cache = require  request cache  ; var request = cache require  request   ;  // not drop in such as var request = require  a request cache module  ;      In my mind   actually   wrapping like that looks more like actual composition which I m a big fan of.  Any thoughts on this? Is there room for another cache module or does it already exist a good enough cache module out there? ,phillipj,open,23,2015-05-27 17:39:39,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

8111,request/request,1631,Move tunnel logic into separate module,Following the current convention for the rest of the internal modules in request I moved out the tunnel logic. The first two commits are strictly non breaking changes. In the third one I removed 3 properties out of the request instance.  I m overriding the  proxyHeaderWhiteList  and  proxyHeaderExclusiveList  via the  options  argument in  setup . In future I would like to not rely on extending the instance in the request ctor  so this approach will help me on the next step of the refactoring. In future I would like to have a strict mechanism with corresponding tests to explicitly define all of the expected public properties for the request instance. This will give us the flexibility to make internal changes more easily  as right now it s not clear if a property is set on the request instance with the intention to be public  or just to carry state through out the instance. And of course someone down the line might actually rely on it.  Also what I noticed is that  options.proxyHeaderExclusiveList  extends  defaultProxyHeaderExclusiveList   but  options.proxyHeaderWhiteList  overrides  defaultProxyHeaderWhiteList . Changing  options.proxyHeaderWhiteList  to extend  defaultProxyHeaderWhiteList  doesn t break anything  therefore we don t have tests for that behavior  so I left it as it is.  //cc @mikeal @nylen  ,simov,closed,0,2015-06-06 13:17:59,2015-06-15 07:11:29,,,,1,1

8089,request/request,1653,docs appear to be incorrect for a simple request,The docs say request should be called like:       js var request = require  request  ; request  http://www.google.com   function  error  response  body      if   error    response.statusCode == 200        console.log body  // Show the HTML for the Google homepage.

8086,request/request,1656,Fix form method,Fixes https://github.com/request/request/issues/1630  It turned out that when the body is set via the  .form    method the  content length  is not being set  and therefore the request is sent as  transfer encoding: chunked   which may cause problems with some servers.  So I refactored out the logic responsible for setting up the  content length :      js function setContentLength        if   Buffer.isBuffer self.body      Array.isArray self.body         self.body = new Buffer self.body        if   self.hasHeader  content length          var length =  Array.isArray self.body         ? self.body.reduce function  a  b   return a   b.length   0        : self.body.length     if  length          self.setHeader  content length   length        else         self.emit  error   new Error  Argument error  options.body.                     Much sexier than it was before  plus that conditional structure allows it to be called again inside the  defer  method. Now for the function name and declaration position it s just there for now  I couldn t figure out a better place to put it  but then again it s visible inside the  defer  function.  Lastly the  test form urlencoded  tests now checks if the  content length  header is present as well. ,simov,closed,0,2015-06-23 08:42:20,2015-06-26 07:35:05,,,,1,1

Does anyone have any knowledge of what changed in 2.50.0 to create this I am having?       js var opts =           method: type          url: settings.gatewayUrl   loc          headers:               Accept:  application/json  text/javascript   / ; q=0.01               Cookie: this.cookies               Content Type :  application/json                     callbacks:              success: successCallback              failure: failureCallback            ; if  data            opts.data = JSON.stringify data ;         Opts is passed as obj to the send function       js Gateway.prototype.send = function  obj        var req =           method: obj.method          url: obj.url          headers: obj.headers          json: true      ;     if  typeof obj.data  ==  undefined            req.body = obj.data;           request req  function  err  res  body            if  err                if  typeof obj.callbacks.failure ===  function                     obj.callbacks.failure err ;                                 if  typeof obj.callbacks.success ===  function                 obj.callbacks.success body ;             console.log req ;             console.log body ;                   ;      Thanks in advance anyone who may have an idea as per what is causing such a difference between the two minor versions of request. All requests go through the send function  GET s work fine  POST s seem to be the ones to break. It is not a cookie issue  as the GET s correctly return. POST s respond with a server code of  requestError   even though I know that doesn t really mean much... ,Hunchmun,closed,4,2015-06-28 12:20:43,2015-06-28 14:51:02,,,,0,1
8078,request/request,1664,Can t pipe from request that has a POST body,I m trying to create a new request object by piping from an Express request. This works fine for GET requests  but for POST requests that have a body  the body does not seem to be copied into the new request. I tried copying over the body manually like so:   let pipedReq = req.pipe request   url:  http://www.example.com   form: req.body    ;   This copies over the body but then I get a  write after end  error when  pipedReq  is cleaned up. Might be related to  1659.  It s easy to reproduce the problem with the following simple Express app:      js  use strict ;  let express = require  express  ; let request = require  request  ;  let app = express  ;  app.use  /    req  res  =>     req.pipe request.post   url:  http://www.example.com   form:   foo:  bar      ;   ;  app.listen process.env.PORT    3000 ;      Backtrace:      Error: write after end     at ClientRequest.OutgoingMessage.write  _http_outgoing.js:413:15      at Request.write  /.../node_modules/request/request.js:1354:25      at end  /.../node_modules/request/request.js:548:16      at Immediate._onImmediate  /.../node_modules/request/request.js:576:7      at processImmediate [as _immediateCallback]  timers.js:358:17      ,matthewgertner,closed,23,2015-06-30 00:29:26,2015-07-16 09:40:37,,,,0,1

8037,request/request,1705,IPv6 :: is misinterpreted ,I ran across this problem in a test scenario. I create an ad hoc express server and tell it to listen on port 0  then get the servers info about address and port in order to request data from it. Pretty standard for test setups.

8033,request/request,1709, forever  option is useless in node 0.12. ,because it s creates new agents every request  for example:      js var request = Request.forever     maxSockets: 2   ;  var r1 = request  http://google.com   function      ; var r2 = request  http://google.com   function      ;  console.log r1.agent === r2.agent ; //prints false  but should be true      Problem is here https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/request.js L486 .  This can be fixed by replacing this line by something like this:      js self.agentClass = self.httpModule.Agent; self.agentOptions.keepAlive = true;      Such behaviour makes sockets not reusable  because creates new pool agent  every http request. ,calibr,closed,1,2015-07-31 20:58:14,2015-08-10 11:32:57,,,,0,1

8031,request/request,1711,Add ability to detect connect timeouts,It s valuable to be able to detect whether a timeout occurred on the  connect  syscall or on the  write / read  syscall of an HTTP request   the former implies that your client can t reach the server and the latter implies the server might not have responded.  For backwards compatibility  and standardization with Unix errno codes  the  code  property of connect timeout errors must remain as  ETIMEDOUT . Instead of changing this value  add a new  connect  property on timeout errors  which is set to true if the error occurred on the  connect  attempt. Clients have to opt in to checking it   in the common read timeout case  it will be set to  false .  Updates the documentation around each timeout to clarify what is going on  and what situations can trigger each timeout.  Updates the README with more accurate documentation about timeout times in the wild. I tried  time curl http://10.255.255.1  and  time curl http://google.com:81  on four different Linux machines  Heroku  boot2docker  Centos on DigitalOcean  a VPS  and the timeout times ranged from 60 seconds to 120 seconds  much longer than the 20 seconds previously suggested.  Updates the README with information on how to detect connection timeout failures. ,kevinburke,closed,7,2015-08-03 12:50:57,2015-08-10 11:23:29,,,,1,1

8029,request/request,1713,HPE_INVALID_CONSTANT: Add error hint that it might be TCP or other non HTTP endpoint,I encountered this error today: https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/issues/574 The code appears to indicate that something unexpected was found trying to parse data from a connection as an HTTP response. Turned out I was making a POST request to a port with Eventstore s TCP listener instead of the correct HTTP port. I didn t know request would even _try_ connecting to non http endpoints  so it took me some help to understand and diagnose.  I understand now that includes responses that don t begin with  HTTP   but my first google searches led me to believe that the HTTP server was running but had a problem sending responses.  I d like to add a hint if parsing fails on the first byte. Does the error come via request or node s  http  library? Is there an appropriate place in the request codebase to attach extra info to the error?       Actual error:  [Error: Parse Error] bytesParsed: 0  code:  HPE_INVALID_CONSTANT      My suggestion:  [Error: Parse Error] bytesParsed: 0  code:  HPE_INVALID_CONSTANT   message:  Failed at first byte  is this an HTTP response?    1706 is also seeing this error  they are talking to youtube via a proxy server  so possibly one of those sent bad responses?

8022,request/request,1720,Mismatch in interface between request and tough cookie for functions getCookieString and setCookie.,There is a mismatch in the interface between request and tough cookie  regarding function getCookieString  and indirectly getCookies .  When I want to assign a tough cookie jar  request does the following in  Request.prototype.jar = function  jar   :  cookies = targetCookieJar.getCookieString urihref   However  tough cookie requires a callback as the second or third parameter in CookieJar.prototype.getCookieString  it is not an optional parameter. See https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough cookie getcookiescurrenturl options cberrcookies and https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough cookie getcookiestring  Because of this  in getCookieString  tough cookie gets a uri as the first and only parameter. That goes wrong and breaks  because it pops the last argument which it believes is the callback function but really is the uri. It replaces that with a new callback function that returns a cookie string  thinking it replaces the original callback argument but really replaces the uri argument . It applies that to getCookies  so that function only gets the new callback as the first parameter and not the uri.  For now I ve updated request.js in my local project to provide a valid callback function to getCookieString. This callback function needs to set the cookie HTTP header  because getCookieString does not return the cookie string  it must go through the callback. So I ve moved that piece of code and variable  cookies  in function Request.prototype.jar is no longer used:      js     if  targetCookieJar          targetCookieJar.getCookieString urihref  function  err  cookies            //if need cookie and cookie is not empty         if   err    cookies    cookies.length                if  self.originalCookieHeader                    // Don t overwrite existing Cookie header                 self.setHeader  cookie   self.originalCookieHeader    ;     cookies                else                   self.setHeader  cookie   cookies                                  ;            So could you please take a look at getCookiestring and its interface?

Since the  buffer  variable is referenced in a closure and never explicitly set to null  the buffer remains referenced for the life of the response object and can not be garbage collected.  It would be much safer to prevent memory leaks  and minimally more efficient to set  buffer = null  as soon as it is no longer required by this code so that it can be garbage collected. ,smithbk,closed,0,2015-08-10 15:56:42,2016-04-14 08:03:47,,,,0,1

8012,request/request,1730,using request.get response in the  pipe  URL,Hi  I cannot find a way to create a flow of get  .pipe   that allow me to compose the  request in pipe   with some data I get in the original get  .  It seem that      js request   .get someUrl    .on  response   function response         // get data from the response to update someNewUrl        .pipe request     .get someNewUrl       someNewUrl is binded at the beginning  even if I pass a funcion  is evaluated at  build time  not after the first GET has computed the  on response  part.   Is probably my fault but I cannot find a proper way to create dynamically generated flows  so I am forced to code a custom flow logic with        js //       if  response1.statusCode == 200         but one of the point of Requests should be build composable flow  right?   Sorry to ask here but I couldn t find any other place where to ask some questions.  Thanks.  ,ildella,closed,1,2015-08-14 12:41:51,2015-08-18 12:29:05,,,,0,1

8010,request/request,1732,Question about perfs and using string as the body param,Hello   It might be a newbie question  but my team team recently faced performance issues   50ms loss  when using the body param as a string. We tracked down the time loss to be around this: https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/request.js L436  We decided to apply a workaround by not using the body param  and instead hook to call [.end] https://nodejs.org/api/http.html http_request_end_data_encoding_callback  native function with a plain string. The goal was to avoid this Buffer transformation that did not seam to provided any added value.  My questions are the following: 1. Does anyone face this issue  or knows what is going wrong? 2. Is there any recommendation  best practices? 3. Would it make sense for me to send a PR avoiding useless Buffer transformation?  ,michelsalib,closed,2,2015-08-17 11:51:32,2015-08-17 14:55:16,,,,0,1

7989,request/request,1753,Support for FORM based authentication,The jazz.net and many other applications use FORM based authentication and expect the client to be a browser that displays the form  collects the user s credentials and POSTs to an authentication redirect with the j_security_check query string.   It would be helpful if request.js supported FORM based authentication. Ideally this would be done by parsing the HTML returned in the response that initiates the FORM based challenge and determining that this is a FORM that is intended to POST with the j_security_check query. Such parsing could be difficult and unreliable. The Jazz platform works around this issue with a header extension: x com ibm team repository web auth msg with value authrequired to indicate the server has initiated a FORM based authentication challenge. Clients can examine this header on an HTTP response with status code 200 and know they should POST the user s credentials in order to complete the original request.  Since x com ibm team repository web auth msg is an unregistered  non standard header  it would not be appropriate to code this directly into request.js to support FORM based authentication. However  the request.js options could be extended to include properties that specify the header name and value that indicates a FORM based challenge. Clients could then configure the request object to detect and resolve FORM based challenges for their particular server if it provides such headers.  Is this something that could be considered as an extension to request.js? If so  I d be happy to code it up. ,jamsden,open,2,2015-09-01 14:16:10,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

But with request.get I am receiving a response that is without line breaks. Therefore I can only assume I am using the package that is not support by requestjs  and am led to question: What is the best way to actually parse out the HTML received from the reqeust.get and requst.post calls?  Thank You. ,rbaindourov,closed,6,2015-09-03 18:17:00,2015-09-03 19:18:21,,,,0,1
7986,request/request,1756,How to pipe bytes to a request dynamically?,I have a Node server that accepts a multi part POST  and I want to pipe the POST parts to an open request as soon as the server receives them.  Currently this is done thusly: 1. Receive multi part POST body part 2. Save all POST body parts to file 3. fs.createReadStream file .pipe request   I want to be able to do this: 1.

7985,request/request,1757,Change request body after pipe to response,Hi   I m trying something like the following:      javascript app.all       req  resp  =>    const url =    req.protocol ://some.ip.addr:80  req.originalUrl  ;  req    .pipe request url      .pipe resp ;   ;      And it works perfectly. But I don t know how to proceed next. What I need to do now is to change the body as follows:      </body>  with  <script /> </body>      Any suggestions ?   ,carlosvillu,closed,3,2015-09-04 07:47:31,2015-11-09 11:48:58,,,,0,1
7984,request/request,1758,Of cookies and browsers,I m in troubles with cookies with this module. I m trying to send a POST request to other service with actual cookies. I have use this code      javascript         var j = request.jar  ;         var cookie = request.cookie req.headers.cookie ;         var url =  http://localhost/api/portal/1/booking ;         j.setCookie cookie  url ;      The problem is that this works in firefox and the console.log jar looks like:      //Firefox jarrrrr   _jar:   store:   idx:   localhost:    /api/portal/1 :   bellahora_portal: Cookie= bellahora_portal=s 3APK00WHjWv1ZCJUICyWPdoU60. 2Fnpm7izsM0D2jD10aPsznDAXR 2Ffr4DWXI8f0c1MeykY; Path=/api/portal/1; complianceCookie=on; _csrf=3xMdA6YJJ6SmMN8SaK2Q5cZ0; hostOnly=true; aAge=0ms; cAge=0ms                   However when I try it with chrome the results looks a bit different:       //Chrome jarrrrr   _jar:   store:   idx:   localhost:    /api/portal/1 :   complianceCookie: Cookie= complianceCookie=on; Path=/api/portal/1; bellahora_portal=s 3AOLglwoAKDRPgHPcHr4vLoiuQ.juIxFQfXJt 2FYvyr5wnrpLIXvwG3S6Vkos3u2Kb9aPeo; _csrf=iPueBdSIgXRRSN1srfDzIQ25; hostOnly=true; aAge=1ms; cAge=1ms                   The result is that then in Chrome request the service doesn t found the user token. I think that te problem becomes for the  complianceCookie from chrome version.  I have looked for a solution but i don t know how to resolve this. Can anyone help me?

7983,request/request,1759, json: true  doesn t set Content Type,Documentation for the  json  options says:  > json   sets body but to JSON representation of value and adds Content type: application/json header. Additionally  parses the response body as JSON.  This doesn t work for  json: true :      js var request = require  request   var x = request     uri:  http://whatever     json: true    // FIXME this should include  content type: application/json  console.log x.headers  // >   host:  whatever   accept:  application/json         The actual implementation also checks for  self.body :      js if  typeof val ===  boolean       if  self.body  == undefined    self.getHeader  content type    ==  application/x www form urlencoded         self.body = safeStringify self.body      if   self.hasHeader  content type            self.setHeader  content type    application/json                    I m dealing [with an API] https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest api.html delete v2 groups groupid  that expects a  Content Type: application/json  even for a DELETE request without a body  so the existing implementation doesn t work here. I m working around that by explicitly setting the header on every  json: true  request  of which there are many littered through this application.  I suggest changing the implementation to make the   self.hasHeader  content type    check independent of the  self.body  check  so if  val  is a boolean  try to set the header  ignoring the missing body.  If that s acceptable  I can look into creating a patch  at least the implementation change should be straight forward. ,jzaefferer,closed,2,2015-09-07 15:03:22,2015-09-16 11:26:41,,,,0,1

It would be nice if there was a blurb about how the two differ and when the callback would be called but no event would be emitted.  For instance if the URL or options used contain an invalid entry.  For a bad URL you get both en error event and a callback with an error value:      js request  http://0.0.0.0/asdf   function error  response      console.log  error callback  ;   .on  error   function error      console.log  error event  ;     Result: error callback error event      But for a malformed only the callback fires:      js request  i like pizza   function error  response      console.log  error callback  ;   .on  error   function error      console.log  error event  ;   ;  Result: error callback     ,tomruggs,open,2,2015-09-21 15:39:23,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7959,request/request,1783,Default content type being set with  json: true  breaks code,With 2.63.0 and https://github.com/request/request/pull/1772  request re introduces subtle breaking behavior. It is considered bad HTTP to send content types with requests without a body. For example  I just had breaking behavior where I use HMAC authentication to sign API requests and then send that signature with request. Since the content type is included in the signature and now I get a content type that wasn t expected  I get signatures that don t match and everything goes kaboom... I can code around it  but I don t think I should have too.  I also am pretty sure this is actually a regression. I don t have time to do the bug search right now  but years ago  I remember this broke against things like express  in like the 2.x days  where a content type that was sent without a body would result in an error. While it was also an express bug  it was determined that setting a content type without a body was bad form. If you need that behavior  it should be opt in  not the default where these headers matter. While the docs seem to imply it  it  seems much more like a doc bug than anything.  Either way  changes to the default behavior or headers is a big enough change that it needs to done with a bit more caution  perhaps even a major version bump. I would vote for reverting that change  as I think it will probably break for a lot more people. ,addisonj,closed,7,2015-09-24 00:27:07,2015-09-25 11:14:25,,,,0,1

7954,request/request,1788,Pinned all dependencies,:wave: Hello   We re all trying to keep our software up to date  yet stable at the same time.  This is the first in a series of automatic PRs to help you achieve this goal. It pins all of the dependencies in your  package.json   so you have complete control over the exact state of your software.  From now on you ll receive PRs whenever one of your dependencies updates   in real time. This way you get all the benefits of up to date dependencies  while having them pinned at the same time. This means:   No more surprises because some of your dependencies didn t follow [SemVer] http://semver.org/ . Your software is always in a state you know about  regardless of _when_ someone does    npm install .   If you have continuous integration set up for this repo  it ll run automatically. Ideally  it will pass and you ll stay up to date with the press of a button. If the updated dependency _does_ break your software  it won t affect your users  because their dependencies are still pinned to the working state.   You can immediately identify which dependency updates break your software  because each one is tested in isolation. You ll also have a branch ready to work on  so adapting to new APIs is way faster.  Merge this PR and you ll have up to date software without the headaches :sparkles:       This pull request was created by [greenkeeper.io] http://greenkeeper.io/ .

7938,request/request,1804,response pull stream is not working,Hi  according to the README  this type of construct      js  .on  response   function response        // unmodified http.IncomingMessage object     response.on ...                   will give me access to unmodified httpIncomingMessage object. Which implements a readable stream.  However  when I try to do something like       js     resp.on  response   function response                response.on  readable   function                         var data = response.read 1000 ;      this gets called but data is always null  Noticed that doing      js     resp.on  response   function response                response.on  data   function data                 does indeed give me the data  but this is a  push  stream which is not acceptable to me. I need to be able to use a  pull  stream  where my code decides when to get the data from the stream and how much of it  etc. Please help Thanks Greg ,bayareagreg,closed,1,2015-10-02 01:53:57,2015-11-09 11:44:33,,,,0,1

When it s used through browserify in the browser  response.request.uri gets the first requested URI.    Reproduce     1. Command line works      bash >npm install request > node var request = require  request  ; request.get  http://irail.be   function  err  response   console.log  Now should contain https in the uri:   response.request.uri.href ;  ;         2.

For the developers on my team that are also expecting this to work  I added this in our wrapper:      javascript if  request_options.url    request_options.url.query      request_options.qs = request_options.url.query   delete request_options.url.query         The options variable is actually generated from several functions but the above assignment is equivalent.  Would you have expected the options variable to work as is and would you like a patch? ,mgenereu,closed,10,2015-10-06 18:18:51,2015-10-13 15:10:18,,,,0,1

7894,request/request,1848,Documentation on ETIMEDOUT   connect not clear,Hi  First of all I m not sure i should have opened an issue for this  but I haven t found any other way to ask this question.  Lately I ve been running into these errors :        code:  ETIMEDOUT   connect: false     code:  ETIMEDOUT   connect: true        And I ve been wondering whether the  connect: true  indicated that this was a connection timeout  as the documentation seems to imply  or that a connection did occurred before the timeout  as my tests seem to indicate .  Here s what the documentation says :  > You can detect timeout errors by checking err.code for an  ETIMEDOUT  value. Further  you can detect whether the timeout was a connection timeout by checking if the err.connect property is set to true. >  >     js > // Set to  true  if the timeout was a connection timeout   false  or  undefined  otherwise. > console.log err.connect === true ; >      And here is the code  [request.js l.811 ] https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/request.js L811   :      js var connectTimeout = self.req.socket    self.req.socket.readable === false self.abort   var e = new Error  ETIMEDOUT   e.code =  ETIMEDOUT  e.connect = connectTimeout self.emit  error   e       So it does seem that  connect: true  means connection timeout. But are you sure that a not readable socket cannot occur even when a connection is established ? And when I get  connect: false   I don t know if I had a readable socket or if there was no socket at all  which can be really misleading.  What do you think ? Thanks. ,nbcraft,open,4,2015-10-19 14:37:14,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7862,request/request,1880,Error on initialization should prevent actual HTTP request from being sent,Hello  Working on a propitiatory piece of app the other day  I ran into a strange exception happening on nextTick. This exception would complain of   can not call method request of undefined  . When I inspected the problem deeply I understood the problem was that the URI which I passed to   request   did not have any protocol defined  like   /bad uri   but also the problem seemed to be triggered because a stream was piped to   request   to upload some files to a WebDAV server. I also confirmed that   request   did in fact call my callback with provided exception error but was still trying to make the actual HTTP request regardless. The exception happened because initialization was failed thus leaving   undefined   variables behind but this case of error was never checked in   Request.write   method which was called in nextTick following stream of data from my file. So I tried to fix this problem by: 1. Creating a test case  which needed [tape catch] https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape catch  to fail tests creating exceptions on process level  2. Setting   self._aborted   to   true   on every error inside   request   3. Checking   self._aborted   in methods   Request.write   and   Request.end   4. Fixing a test case in   test bearer auth   that falsely relied on   request   making HTTP requests regardless of errors in it s initialization  The following is an image showing the stacktrace of exception which I m talking about:   [image] https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10746709/10868130/c9bcd85e 807b 11e5 8297 78d6d5a53eaa.png  ,arcana261,closed,7,2015-11-01 09:45:32,2015-11-14 12:22:34,,,,1,1

7856,request/request,1886,Content Length header may not be in defaultProxyHeaderWhiteList ,In [RFC 7231] https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7231.txt   section 4.3.6  it says:   > A payload within a CONNECT request message has no defined semantics;sending a payload body on a CONNECT request might cause some existing implementations to reject the request.  So it is better not have a body in the CONNECT request. From [RFC 7230] https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7230.txt   section 3.3.2:   > A user agent SHOULD NOT send a Content Length header field when the request message does not contain a payload body and the method semantics do not anticipate such a body.  since the payload body is not in the request  the  content length  should not be set.  Therefore  the  content length  header should not be in the proxy header white list by default. ,yaxia,closed,4,2015-11-04 08:17:20,2015-11-19 10:50:47,,,,0,1

My use case requires more flexibility for our HTTP caching  and I found these 2 handy headers  stale while revalidate and stale if error  defined in this RFC:  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861 page 3  I was thinking of working on this and submitting a PR to this request repo.   I was wondering if this is something you guys would consider?  If it s something that would be an outright rejection I will instead just make it a separate NPM module. :   Thanks. ,debnath,open,2,2015-11-11 07:11:06,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7832,request/request,1910,Unable to shrinkwrap if the dependency tree contains request@2.66.0,This bug seems a bit crazy  but hear me out:  We recently updated some dependencies and tried to shrinkwrap  but shrinkwrap continually fails with extraneous dependencies in the module tree.  It appears to be related to the recent release of request  so:  If I try to shrinkwrap request:      git clone git@github.com:request/request.git npm i   production  /code/opensource/request   npm shrinkwrap npm ERR  Problems were encountered npm ERR  Please correct and try again. npm ERR  extraneous: sshpk@1.6.2 /Users/andrewn/code/opensource/request/node_modules/sshpk      However  if I try:      git checkout d46a4c727ed7368e4625f9204f140904cc3f4478   2.61.1 rm  rf node_modules/ npm i   production npm shrinkwrap     > Success      Note  that I m not actually trying to shrinkwrap request. The problem is that if I try shrinkwrap my module and my module depends on request  then the shrinkwrap for my module will fail with the same error.  I m not sure if this is a problem with  request  or a problem with  npm   most likely it s  npm   but I m reporting it here since other people are likely to experience the same problem  we ve tried this on different developers environments and are getting the same issue   Some details:   npm@2.14.11   node@v0.10.40 ,suprememoocow,closed,9,2015-11-18 15:28:55,2015-11-19 07:42:11,,,,0,1

7828,request/request,1914,DNS lookup isn t cancelled when timeout is reached,Hi   I ve run into a situation where if our Linux device is configured with an invalid static IP  e.g. customer makes a typo in the configuration   DNS lookup takes 40 seconds then times out and  request  fails with the appropriate error   ENOTFOUND  on  getaddrinfo  syscall .  This is an issue in our pre startup script  since passing  timeout: 5000  makes the callback return the error after 5 seconds  but internally the DNS lookup doesn t seem to be cancelled  because node doesn t exit until 40 seconds after the request is made even though none of our code is left running.  My current workaround is to call  process.kill process.pid   on a timeout error  so the device doesn t sit doing nothing for 35 seconds. ,DuBistKomisch,closed,6,2015-11-19 02:40:34,2015-11-20 02:34:48,,,,0,1

7823,request/request,1919,ETIMEDOUT with new version,I ve been running 2.55.0 with iojs 2 in production for several months and never noticed any problem related to request. Last week I upgraded to 2.66.0 with node 4.2.2 and noticed ETIMEDOUT happening regularly. I created an isolated test script confirming that there indeed seems to be something wrong with 2.66.0   node 4.2.2.  Details: I created this test script      JavaScript  use strict ;  let request = require  request  ; let fs = require  fs  ; let json = JSON.parse fs.readFileSync  node_modules/request/package.json    utf8   ; const REQUEST_VERSION = json.version; const NODE_VERSION = process.version;  function ping       request       method:     HEAD       url:        http://a server of mine       headers:     User Agent :  haha        timeout:   5000      time:      true      strictSSL: false      function error  response  body        if  error          console.log NODE_VERSION  REQUEST_VERSION   error   error.code ;       else         console.log NODE_VERSION  REQUEST_VERSION   good  ;           ;    ping  ; setInterval ping  5500 ;      I set up a new centos VM @ DigitalOcean  installed both iojs v2.1.0 linux x64 and node v4.2.2 linux x64. I copied my script into two folders  one with the latest version of request  2.66.0   the other with the npm shrinkwrapped version and dependencies of request 2.55.0. I let both scripts run concurrently over night  the one with the old request using iojs  and the other with node. I just checked the result:  The old version ran 6821 times without a single error. The output is 6821 lines of  v2.1.0 2.55.0 good .  The new version ran 6816 times with four errors. The output is 6812 lines of  v4.2.2 2.66.0 good   and 4 lines of  v4.2.2 2.66.0 error ETIMEDOUT . The errors seems kind of randomly spread out  at lines 703  1686  2159  and 5326 in the output log .  Next  I ll run both scripts concurrently with node 4.2.2  i.e. not with iojs anymore and will report back. ,pekeler,open,13,2015-11-19 14:49:33,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7812,request/request,1930,Request stream   manipulating cookie before response piping,I have a Express proxy that uses request to make CRUD calls to a remote server. On the response  I do cookie manipulation to change the path. This is the code here.          request           method: req.method          url: proxyUrl          jar: jar          headers: headers          json: jsonBody         function error  response  body             if  error    response.statusCode  == 201    response.statusCode  == 200                logger.info  proxying failed   reason:     error ;             return res.status response.statusCode .send body ;          ;         var cookies = jar.getCookies proxyUrl ;         for  var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i                  var cookie = cookies[i];             if  cookie.path  ==  /                     cookie.path =  / ; //change path from /api to /                 cookie.secure =  os.hostname  .indexOf  local   >  1 ? false : true ;                           res.cookie cookie ;          ;         res.headers = response.headers;         return res.status response.statusCode .send body ;       ;      This works fine. But now  NodeJs comes with streams. So  I write this piece of code to achieve the same with nodejs streams.          req.pipe          request               method:req.method              url: proxyUrl              jar: jar              json:req.body             .on  response   function response            var cookies = jar.getCookies proxyUrl ;         console.log cookies ;         if  response.statusCode === 201    response.statusCode === 200    response.statusCode === 202                logger.info  successfully proxied  ;              for  var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i                      var cookie = cookies[i];                 if  cookie.path  ==  /                         cookie.path =  / ; //change path from /api to /                     cookie.secure =  os.hostname  .indexOf  local   >  1 ? false : true ;                                   jar.setCookie cookie  proxyUrl ;                         else               logger.info  proxying failed   reason:     error     refer body  ;                 .pipe res      ,girishbr,open,2,2015-11-24 00:22:01,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7808,request/request,1934,Error: socket hang up in Node 4.2.1  but not 0.12 ,Hello   I m trying to debug this issue: https://github.com/blakmatrix/node zendesk/issues/110  Having looked into it a bit  it looks like it is a bug in  request  the only alternative could be that the API I m making requests to is rejecting the useragent with  node/4.2.1  in and not the one with  node/0.12  in.   request  is being passed the same data in both versions of Node  and is being called multiple times. It never fails on the first time it is called  it usually fails between the third and sixth times it s being passed only slightly different data  page numbers   but sporadically fails.  This is some sample data that sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails:        stores:      defaults:       Literal           type:  literal           store: [Object]          mtimes:             readOnly: true          loadFrom: null          logicalSeparator:  :         sources: []    headers:       Content Type :  application/json        Accept:  application/json         User Agent :  node zendesk/1.1.5  node/4.2.1         Authorization:  Basic [redacted]       uri:  https://[redacted].zendesk.com/api/v2/search.json?page=3 query=checkout failure     method:  GET         And request is being given the following defaults:        jar: RequestJar   _jar: CookieJar   store:   idx:             encoding: null    timeout: 240000    proxy: null    secureOptions: 134217728        The following error is  eventually  thrown:      Error: socket hang up     at createHangUpError  _http_client.js:203:15      at TLSSocket.socketOnEnd  _http_client.js:288:23      at emitNone  events.js:72:20      at TLSSocket.emit  events.js:166:7      at endReadableNT  _stream_readable.js:903:12      at doNTCallback2  node.js:439:9      at process._tickCallback  node.js:353:17       What could be causing this? Is this a bug in request  or is there something wrong with how we re calling it?  I m too far deep into a library I am unfamiliar with to make a stripped down test case. If necessary  I can make one wanted to check it wasn t something obvious before investing the time  first  though.  Here is where request is initiated: https://github.com/blakmatrix/node zendesk/blob/master/lib/client/client.js L35 L41   Here is where it is called: https://github.com/blakmatrix/node zendesk/blob/master/lib/client/client.js L100 L102  Help would be much appreciated  thanks  ,callumacrae,open,13,2015-11-25 12:20:11,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7798,request/request,1944,Cannot set localAddress to IPv6,Hi  I m getting a  bind EINVAL  error but only when attempting to connect to https. Do you have any insight as to why this might be happening?  Here s my error:     [Error: bind EINVAL 2604:a880:1:20::27:a000]   code:  EINVAL     errno:  EINVAL     syscall:  bind     address:  2604:a880:1:20::27:a000      It only has this issue when using IPv6 and https at the same time. Here s my proof of concept code:      var request = require  request  ; var opt =   url: http://icanhazip.com   // doesn t work: url: https://www.google.ca/search?q=what is my ip address   timeout:5000  headers:      // User Agent :  Mozilla/5.0  Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64  AppleWebKit/537.36  KHTML  like Gecko  Chrome/48.0.2564.10 Safari/537.36     ; opt.family = 6; // Works fine if the following line is removed: opt.localAddress =  2604:a880:1:20::27:a000 ; request opt function error  response  data        if   error    response    response.statusCode == 200             console.log data ;       else           if   response   console.log response.statusCode ;         console.log error ;         ;        Something really interesting is that if I comment out the  opt.localAddress  line and just let it use  opt.family = 6  then it will work  and with the same exact interface that I m trying to set  localAddress  to. But if I attempt to set  localAddress   Only while using HTTPS  then it will come up with the  bind EINVAL  error.    I highly suspect that it s not a  bind EINVAL  error because I can connect to it using standard  http  library and from command line and PHP using this interface. I really would like to use this library more than others. Please help me  : 1:  ,jaggedsoft,closed,1,2015-12-03 09:55:42,2015-12-03 22:53:30,,,,0,1

7794,request/request,1948,Updating request defaults in place,I m trying to figure out how to I could fit in this pattern using the request library.  Currently I have a  request.js wrapper module that is imported by all my other modules that need to make http calls.  request.js       js var options =     baseUrl: window.location.protocol   baseUrl    json: true    simple: false    resolveWithFullResponse: true  ;  module.exports = require  request promise  .defaults options ;      While the user is using the app  they can also  log in   and at that point I d like for all their requests to be authorized with a new header.  I want to do something like this:      js var request = require  ./lib/request  ; //... onLoginCompleted: function user  rememberme         this.user = Immutable.Map user ;       request.defaults   Authorization :  Bearer   this.user.get  token    ;       this.trigger this.user  this.active ;             At which point  I d like for   require  ./lib/request  ;  to have new defaults  so that all other modules importing my request wrapper not make authorized calls. Is this possible? ,nemosupremo,open,3,2015-12-07 23:08:28,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1
7793,request/request,1949,helpers.isReadStream identifies only fs created streams,https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/lib/helpers.js L41   .isReadStream  checks to see if the provided object has three truthy properties:  .readable    .path   and  .mode . While these three properties all exist on streams created by [ fs.createReadStream ] https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html fs_fs_createreadstream_path_options   this is not true for all readable streams that may contain file data.  In particular  I am working on a project using  sails@0.11.3  and  skipper@0.5.8 . The  upstream  paradigm that  skipper  uses creates a transform stream containing file data. This allows  sails  users to write file management middleware that sends file data to any desired storage location without first writing any data to disk. Because the file data is coming directly from the request and into the transform stream  no file system read is happening  and therefore no  .path  and  .mode  properties exist for these streams which contain file data.  I m opening this issue to ask whether there is a more flexible way for  request  to identify readable streams. Node exposes four different stream classes that implement the readable interface   Readable    Duplex    Transform   and  PassThrough . All of these stream types appear to share two properties:      javascript [ Readable    Transform    Duplex    PassThrough ].forEach function type      var stream = new require  stream  [type]  ;   console.log type    stream._readableState    stream.readable ;   ;  /  Output Readable true true Transform true true Duplex true true PassThrough true true  /      One possible refactor that appears to allow  request  to accept non fs file streams while avoiding a regression is:      javascript function isReadStream  rs      return rs.readable      rs.path    rs.mode     rs._readableState ;        Are there any foreseeable downsides to opening  request  up to accepting any readable stream  as opposed to only those created by  fs ? Is there a catastrophic failure point somewhere where  request  is assuming the stream to be an  fs  stream? ,jackwanders,closed,4,2015-12-08 03:39:00,2015-12-11 20:18:50,,,,0,1

7791,request/request,1951,Safari: Empty Bearer Authorization header causes error in Safari  Desktop/iOS ,Currently  I have a default request object setup with the following options:      js var options =     baseUrl: window.location.protocol   baseUrl    json: true    simple: false    resolveWithFullResponse: true    auth:       bearer: function           if  AdminStore == null            AdminStore = require  stores/admin  ;               return AdminStore.getToken  ;            ;      When the user is not logged in   getToken    will return  null . When this happens request auth code [will opt to send an empty Bearer token] https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/lib/auth.js L45 .   auth.js       js if  sendImmediately    typeof sendImmediately ===  undefined         if  typeof bearer ===  function           bearer = bearer             var authHeader =  Bearer      bearer           self.sentAuth = true    return authHeader         This results in the Authorization header being set to  Authorization: Bearer . For some reason Desktop Safari 9.0.1 and iOS Safari 9.1 don t like this  and when you try to set the header you get  DOM Exception 12: An invalid or illegal string was specified.  If I return a garbage string in  Bearer   such as  abc   the error does not occur.  Possibly related: https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/solved ios9 fails with setrequestheader native with custom headers in http service/32399/8   In any case  it seems to me the best option would be not set the header at all if the  bearer  function returns null. ,nemosupremo,open,3,2015-12-08 12:53:18,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7778,request/request,1964,Use isstream for more robust stream.Readable detection,See https://github.com/request/request/issues/1949 for the original issue description.  In short   helpers.isReadStream  is overly restrictive in what it deems to be a readable stream. Specifically  only streams created via  fs  that stream file data from disk pass the test of this function. However  it is entirely valid to have a non  fs  stream that contains valid file data  e.g. streams generated from file data contained in  multipart/form data  requests.  This pull request updates  helpers.isReadStream  to use the  .Readable  method contained within the existing dependency  isstream . However   isstream.isReadable  on its own is not restrictive enough to detect the kinds of readable streams that  request  needs to detect  as the  http.IncomingMessage  and its sub classes are also readable streams  yet they need to be rejected by our test.  So  the combination of  isstream.isReadable  and  instanceof http.IncomingMessage  should be sufficient to successfully detect non http readable streams that may contain file data. ,jackwanders,closed,4,2015-12-11 15:01:29,2015-12-11 20:17:35,,,,1,1

7770,request/request,1972,How to force HTTP 1.1?,More and more websites started to use HTTP 2.0 and sending HTTP requests with Nodejs to such websites return no responses  no statusCode or body or headers .  These websites usually have HTTP 1.1 fallback  yet  HTTP requests with Nodejs somehow doesn t trigger this fallback.  Is there a workaround for this?  As an example  we shall normally get HTTP 200 from teh request below but it returns no response:      javascript var request = require  request  ;  request  https://www.tunetheweb.com       headers:        User Agent :  request         function  error  response  body      if  error        console.error error ;     else         console.log response.statusCode ;            ,umutm,open,1,2015-12-17 05:25:15,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,Needs investigation,,,0,1
7769,request/request,1973,[Error: socket hang up] code:  ECONNRESET  when  knownLength  is set for multipart request,Hi   I run a simple PUT request to upload something like the following      js var util = require  util  ; var fs = require  fs  ; var http = require  http  ; var request = require  request  ; request.debug = true;  var r = request.put  http://www.xxx.de/index.html     function optionalCallback err  httpResponse  body        console.log util.inspect err  ;   ; var form = r.form  ; form.append  index.html   fs.createReadStream  ./index.html          filename:  index.html       contentType:  text/html       knownLength: 1   ;      I always get    [Error: socket hang up] code:  ECONNRESET    . This error is too much difficult to debug. What happens there? If I remove  knownLength  or set it as 0  it works.  If I use file path instead of stream in form data   knownLength  is smaller than 30  the same error occurs. If the value of  knownLength  is biggeer than 30  it works again.  I really can not understand this ridiculous problem. Who knows what s the  knownLength  used for except for  Content Length  header. Is it used for an option of  fs.createReadStream  as well? I guess the file stream is close before request stream starts to pipe.  Best regards  Kevin ,kevinprotoss,open,0,2015-12-17 11:27:52,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,Help (please use Stackoverflow),,,0,1

Firefox handles this kind of redirection fine  so I presume other servers out there may be sending redirects the same way.  Do you have any plans to support this redirection mode in your code base?

7756,request/request,1986, followAllRedirects  option may cause odd behavior,Under some highly specific circumstances involving redirects  the  request  may call it s callback argument with an error  yet successfully complete the operation.  The situation is:   1.   The client sends a PUT request with a large enough amount of data.   2.   The server responds with a redirect after it has received the request headers  and hasn t yet received the whole data body .   3.   The server drops the connection unexpectedly.  The library handles this sitation in a bad way. It simultaneously:   continues following the redirect  and potentially successfully completes the operation .    calls the callback with an error.  I ve assembled a fully working example that illustrates the problem: https://github.com/tempname11/request redirect bug  Actual output:      Server 1: starting... Server 2: starting... Client: starting... Server 1: have request for / Server 1: Sent 307. Server 1: dropping connection. Client: error ECONNRESET Server 2: have request for / Server 2: Received 33554432 bytes. Server 2: sent 200. Server 2: closing connection.      Expected output   A        Server 1: starting... Server 2: starting... Client: starting... Server 1: have request for / Server 1: Sent 307. Server 1: dropping connection. Server 2: have request for / Server 2: Received 33554432 bytes. Server 2: sent 200. Server 2: closing connection. Client: have response.      Or  alternatively  expected output   B        Server 1: starting... Server 2: starting... Client: starting... Server 1: have request for / Server 1: Sent 307. Server 1: dropping connection. Client: error ECONNRESET      My point being that either behavior   A   or   B   should happen  that is:   This specific error should be ignored and further redirected exchanges should happen as normal.   the callback should receive an error  and no further redirected exchanges should be made.  I ve made a quick fix that results in behavior   A  .

7734,request/request,2008,Maximum call stack size exceeded in redirects,Hi   I m randomly getting the error below  but unfortunately I have not been able to come up with a reproducible case.  Looking at the code  there appears to be a problem with redirect handling.  Request s code below      response.on  close   function        if   self._ended        self.response.emit  end            and Node s http code seem to be stuck in a loop.  Probably to prevent this issue  I think you might want to remove the request event handler before emitting an event on the response.  Note I m using request version 2.63.0.

7732,request/request,2010,Content Type header missing when passing BASIC Authentication,I am using request to interact with TestRail API. Since it uses basic authentication I am setting the headers as follows:      var mainHeaders =          Authorization : Basic     new Buffer config.userName    :    config.APIKEY .toString  base64           Content type :  application/json     ;      but the TestRail API rejects saying Content Type header is missing. Checking the response from the server I can see the client request header was:           Authorization :  Basic <my authentication data>      accept :  application/json      referer :  http://xxxxx.testrail.net/index.php?/api/v2/get_cases/1 suite_id=1         So I am assuming the Content Type header is being   removed   somehow.   Is there any reason the Content Type header could be removed from the request header object? The header above is all I set.  It might not be request problem  but I am current lost. Any help is appreciated?  Thanks  Paulo ,pedgarcia,open,2,2016-01-13 22:40:42,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,Help (please use Stackoverflow),,,0,1
7731,request/request,2011,Question: fire and forget,Is it possible to use request to run a  POST   but not want to worry about the response?  In particular  I have a CLI that s posting a beacon/analytics to a server  so it s important the request has been sent  but waiting for the response is not required   and currently waiting is adding a minor latency to the CLI s exit time  which I m looking to reduce .  Is this possible with request? ,remy,closed,4,2016-01-14 08:53:35,2016-01-20 13:04:36,,,,0,1

7724,request/request,2018,Fix remote memory disclosure with multipart attachments,If the node process makes a request with a multipart attachment  and the type of the  body  option is a  Number   then that many bytes of uninitialized memory will be sent in the body of the request. Here s an example:      js request     method:  POST     uri:  http://localhost:8000     multipart: [  body: 1000  ]        And here s a more complete reproducible example:      js var http = require  http   var request = require  request    http.createServer function  req  res      var data =      req.setEncoding  utf8     req.on  data   function  chunk        console.log  data       data  = chunk        req.on  end   function          // this will print uninitialized memory from the client     console.log  Client sent: n   data         res.end     .listen 8000   request     method:  POST     uri:  http://localhost:8000     multipart: [  body: 1000  ]    function  err  res  body      if  err  return console.error  upload failed:   err    console.log  sent           This PR fixes the issue by coercing the type of the  body  option to a string.

7714,request/request,2028,Fix event listener leak,When request handles a redirect  extra event listeners for the  pipe  and  end  events are erroneously attached to the request object.  This causes a few problems:   When the request finally completes and  end  is fired  the [cleanup function] https://github.com/request/request/blob/v2.67.0/request.js L796 L800  ends up running multiple times  1   number of redirects .  This doesn t actually hurt anything  but it is wasteful.   If someone were to pipe to the request after a redirect had occurred  which is an error   the [ pipe  event handler] https://github.com/request/request/blob/v2.67.0/request.js L506 L534  will run multiple times  thus emitting the  error  event multiple times.   If there are 7 or more redirects  node will print leak warnings to stderr:       node  warning: possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 pipe listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners   to increase limit. Trace     at Request.addListener  events.js:239:17      at Request.init  ./node_modules/request.js:507:8      at Redirect.onResponse  ./node_modules/lib/redirect.js:148:11      at Request.onRequestResponse  ./node_modules/request.js:898:22      at emitOne  events.js:77:13      at ClientRequest.emit  events.js:169:7      at HTTPParser.parserOnIncomingClient [as onIncoming]  _http_client.js:415:21      at HTTPParser.parserOnHeadersComplete  _http_common.js:88:23      at Socket.socketOnData  _http_client.js:305:20      at emitOne  events.js:77:13   node  warning: possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 end listeners added.

This fixes the leak for good by not attaching additional handlers if they re already there.  The diff makes it look like there are more changes than there actually are due to changes in indentation.  The only actual change is to wrap the event listeners:      diff    if  EventEmitter.listenerCount self   ...   === 0         ...

7709,request/request,2033,HTTP/2 support,Hello Request maintainers and community. I am creating this issue to discuss whether there s interest in implementing HTTP/2 support in Request.  I have a working fork of Request with hacked in HTTP/2 support  but it only does what I need for my use case  the use case is load testing   I only ever connect to and send requests to one host  and I m not concerned with potentially maintaining multiple connections to different hosts .  Some considerations:   Should  http2  be an explicit option? Do we want to upgrade to HTTP/2 automatically if the server supports it?   HTTP/2 has  push  events   these may need to be exposed to the user.   With HTTP/2 there s a persistent connection to the server which probably can t be  unref   d safely as is the case with HTTP. The user will need to be able to close the connection manually.   Should HTTP/2 without TLS be allowed?  TLS is not mandatory  but strongly encouraged    Should this be done in Request Next?  https://github.com/request/request/issues/1982   I d be happy to take ownership of this and write and submit a proper PR based on the discussion here.  Thanks ,hassy,open,5,2016-01-25 13:37:49,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7694,request/request,2048,Unhandled HPE_INVALID_CONSTANT error on 304 responses,Consistently I m getting an error when the server responds with a 304.  I was able to mitigate it by using native HTTP module  however it s defeats the purpose of the request module that I have to do that.

7684,request/request,2058,Karma fixes for latest versions,So  here is some fixes that closes  2035 and  2044 and  2056  First off  one of the issues were that we are testing across 3 versions of npm. They have different behaviours when encountering peerDependencies. So ideally I would almost say we should upgrade npm to at least npm@2 for node 0.10. But open to opinions there. This was the least disruptive change  in my opinion.  Second  one of the issues were pointing out that the response object changed for one of the tests. So I ran the same test code with node  where the result was illuminating the fact that the browser test was testing for something only happening in the browser. So I changed that test  so it can check for a result that also is the same result when running on node.  Fixes  2035 Fixes  2044 Closes  2056 ,eiriksm,closed,4,2016-02-04 19:33:59,2016-02-05 07:03:24,,,,1,1

However I only have access to the return value when using callback API but we are normally using promise API where the return value  slot  is taken by the promise and we cannot interact with the stream.  I propose extending the  body  option to accept stream which would do this for me so that I don t need to waste the return value  slot .

7654,request/request,2088,Replace lib/getProxyFromURI.js with proxy from env,I was looking for a package that implements support for the  de facto  standard proxy environment variables  but didn t find any except for getProxyFromURI.js in this library. My two main issues with the implementation is that it uses suffix matching  e.g.  NO_PROXY=example.com  also matches  notexample.com   and that it uses  HTTP_PROXY  even for https URLs . The latter is problematic if I want to proxy all HTTP requests  but not HTTPS requests  because there is no way to get  NO_PROXY  to stop matching https requests. I ve fixed all of the above issues and published the result as https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy from env  and decided to submit a PR here so that eventually all Node.js applications/libraries that want to support setting the proxy via the environment variables do so in a consistent and standard way.  Compared to the existing implementation in request  there are two backwards incompatible changes  see the commit message for other differences and more details :    HTTP_PROXY  is no longer used for https requests  use  HTTPS_PROXY    or  ALL_PROXY  .   The items in  NO_PROXY  are no longer used in suffix matching  but used as an exact match  unless the item starts with a dot or asterisk  then suffix matching will be used .  The proxy from env library [has an extensive set of tests] https://github.com/Rob  W/proxy from env/blob/master/test.js . With a small modification  the tests can also be used to check the existing implementation:      sh git clone https://github.com/Rob  W/proxy from env.git cd proxy from env    Get current implementation from request wget https://github.com/request/request/blob/c2dab797d362ad158e0399140aa59829fa50d9b3/lib/getProxyFromURI.js?raw=true  Oindex.js    Change module signature to match the library. echo  module.exports= getProxyForUrl: function s    return getProxyFromURI require  url  .parse s        ;   ;  >> index.js    Install dependencies and run tests npm install npm test      Here is the test output: http://pastebin.com/raw/Dk9f79Vq  anything without a checkmark is a test failure . ,Rob--W,closed,7,2016-02-21 15:46:35,2017-02-22 00:14:51,,abandoned,,,1,1

7642,request/request,2100,Proposal to allow setting of timeout with env var,When I start work with an unfamiliar open source project I try to make sure the tests pass. Some of these projects use request. Sometimes  the connection or requests their tests make timeout. It would be nice if I could get the tests to pass without modifying any of the code of a build that passes in other contexts. Being able to set a different timeout across all the calls made with request is one way that I can work around exceptional latency  without changing the requirements of the open source project under test.  I am curious as to your own approach for debugging this. Sometimes unfamiliar open source projects layer abstractions on top of request. It can be difficult to find where to provide an alternate timeout value. ,cpb,closed,11,2016-02-26 23:51:54,2016-02-29 18:04:25,,,,1,1

7633,request/request,2109,Calls to request options  callback  shall never throw an error and call the callback instead,As discussed briefly in  1429  calls to  request options  callback   shall never throw an error as this is not a recommended error handling pattern. If a function return an error asynchronously  then all the errors including those can be identified right away  shall be returned asynchronously.      js var options =     url: url    method:  HEAD     body:  Some data    request options  function  err  response  body      // never called    // throws an error instead      For a more detailed discussion on the matter  please refer to [Error Handling in Node.js] https://www.joyent.com/developers/node/design/errors   section  Throw  Callback  or EventEmitter? .  Please consider updating the error handling to always call the provided callback instead of throwing errors. ,gabmontes,open,0,2016-03-02 22:37:20,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7629,request/request,2113,Extra optional parameter,Allows the user to define using the options an extra option which he can use inside the callback functions.  This is important when you use request inside any loop  as it is not recommended to define callback functions inside a loop but rather use a pre defined method. ,ShaharHD,closed,13,2016-03-04 19:23:46,2016-03-08 18:17:06,,,,1,1

7620,request/request,2122,Don t set content length if transfer encoding is already set to chunked.,Hi there   This patch solves a bug I experienced with requests having the following form:      js    request          url:  http://localhost:8000         method:  post         headers:   Transfer Encoding :  chunked          formData:            file:               value: fs.createReadStream   somefile.txt                options:                  filename: encodeURIComponent   somefile.txt                                         ;      A request sent like this will set content length even though transfer encoding is set to chunked.  This will provoke an ECONNRESET on an express application listening to this request  which  to make things worse  will fail silently.  This request is malformed and goes against the standard  so I propose this patch to solve it.  Please feel free to modify the code style and even the functions invoked. My sole purpose is to make request avoid setting content length when transfer encoding=chunked is present.  Thank you very much  ,fpereiro,closed,2,2016-03-08 12:47:03,2017-02-22 00:14:33,,abandoned,,,1,1

7613,request/request,2129,Query strings auto encoding and OData APIs,Let s say I have an OData API that responds to the following query:      https://app.io/Products? filter=Name ne  Milk       I compose the request like this:      js const request = require  request  ;  request     method:  GET     url:  https://app.io/Products     qs:        filter:  Name ne   Milk           function error  response      if  error        throw error;       ;       request  will send a GET request to  https://app.io/Products? 24filter=Name 20ne 20 27Milk 27   you can check  response.request.uri.path  .  Notice the dollar sign from   filter  is escaped to   24   causing my request to not match the intended route and fail.  This behaviour comes from  querystring :      sh   node > var querystring = require  querystring  ; > querystring.stringify    filter:  Name ne   Milk      ;   24filter=Name 20ne 20  Milk         I understand this the default behaviour from a NodeJS built in library  but it causes a lot of pain when using OData query strings.   Have you encountered such behaviour before? Is there a way to disable the automatic encoding from query strings?  What I m currently doing is passing the query string manually to  url  instead of using the handy  qs  object  although its far from ideal  and I have to scan the current url for existing query strings to append correctly. ,jviotti,open,3,2016-03-15 17:43:15,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7606,request/request,2136,Re evaluate dependency usage,Yesterday a developer unpublished the left pad module and broke a lot of builds. The lesson for me at least was to be a lot more careful about which dependencies we take. Especially in cases where the code is trivially inline able  it may make sense to bring the code into the project  rather than rely on a dependency  and have all of  request  s users rely on that dependency .  Here are some that could be inlined:    is typed array : https://github.com/hughsk/is typedarray/blob/master/index.js    caseless : https://github.com/request/caseless/blob/master/index.js    isstream : https://github.com/rvagg/isstream/blob/master/isstream.js    json stringify safe : https://github.com/isaacs/json stringify safe/blob/master/stringify.js    stringstream   especially if you ignore the AlignedStringDecoder code  https://github.com/mhart/StringStream/blob/master/stringstream.js  Furthermore  readable stream   buried under  bl   takes dependencies on  isarray  and  util deprecate   which seem pretty trivial to copy inline.  ,kevinburkeshyp,open,4,2016-03-23 17:12:36,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

Setting jar through defaults  json being set with the request :      javascript request.defaults       jar: true   ;      >   ForbiddenError: invalid csrf token...

Even with the content type header set as www url encoded  AFAIK there isn t a requirement that the body be encoded in any way unless it exceeds certain size limits  nor that services have to decode the body of a PUT. It can just be raw.

7580,request/request,2162,Adding a transform stream to request proxying,Hi there  I ve used request for many different projects  and I admire your work    thank you   This line from the documentation  the one line proxying  works perfectly for me:      javascript req.pipe request  http://mysite.com/doodle.png   .pipe resp       If I access this node script from my browser  my browser renders the correct response.   This is desirable     I tried adding a transform stream  which I intended to accomplish nothing other than make sure it works with a transform stream :      javascript var transform = new require  stream  .Transform  ; transform._transform = function chunk  encoding  done      this.push chunk ;   done  ;  ; req.pipe request  http://mysite.com/doodle.png   .pipe transform .pipe resp ;      If I access this node script from my browser  my browser prompts me to download the file  rather than rendering it directly in the browser.   This is undesirable.    My understanding is that adding the transform stream in between the request stream and response stream broke something. Given that I m not very familiar with node streams  let alone request streams   can you shed some insight on why this is happening?  I m certain this is not a bug  just myself being a noob. However  any insights you can share on how request relates to this is very appreciated  :  ,dillonforrest,closed,1,2016-04-10 02:07:43,2016-04-10 08:09:01,,,,0,1
7579,request/request,2163,response.pipe doesn t work as expected,I wanted to do some conditional piping depending on the response from the first request.  Starting from this example in the docs:      javascript req.pipe request  http://mysite.com/doodle.png   .pipe resp       I wanted to do something like this instead:      javascript // req and resp come from http.createServer or express.js  var r = request url  function error  response      r.pipe resp ;   ;  req.pipe r ;      My desired result is for the end user to not see the difference between both implementations. However  in the second implementation  the server just hangs. I added  r.emit  end    and  r.emit  close    after piping to  resp   but the server doesn t return anything there.  How can I troubleshoot the second implementation so that I can both 1  have the same user experience as the first implementation and also 2  be able to add extra logic based on the  response  variable before committing to piping to  resp ? ,dillonforrest,closed,1,2016-04-10 08:26:43,2016-04-10 20:14:12,,,,0,1

7554,request/request,2188,Support for aws service name,There is a problem when using sigv4 to sign requests for URL endpoints that are not the traditional Amazon endpoint. The  aws4  library that works in conjunction with this module  will introspect the host url to determine the  service  and the  region . Unfortunately  if you use DNS entries to provide your user with a more traditional API endpoint  the service name  and the region  are no longer deterministic.  Consider the same endpoint in two different formats 1. https://ye4r9923df.execute api.us west 2.amazonaws.com/test 2. https://myapi.example.org  The second host name has been configured via Cloudfront to direct to the API Gateway endpoint shown in the first example. However  a request signed and executed against URL 1 will succeed  while a request against URL 2 will fail with this exception.      Error: Credential should be scoped to correct service:  execute api .       If the aws property on the request is modified to accept a  service  property  and this property is passed through to  aws4   the request will succeed. It may even be useful to allow a region to be specified in the same way.   It is unfortunate that AWS is forcing clients to know something as extraneous as a service name in order to invoke a general API endpoint. ,oravecz,closed,3,2016-04-20 21:01:51,2017-02-22 00:14:21,,abandoned,,,1,1

If  for instance  one puts an object in  body  it ll fail because it s not the right type with a very obtuse exception. This is even more confusing if you re using  request promise . Ideally  the api shouldn t do this. It should have the body/form merged into the single storage container body  and a new option   encodeRequestAs  form/json.  This would also work well with a  decodeResponseAs  which could provide JSON or custom decoding modules  YAML  etc. . ,EvanCarroll,open,0,2016-05-16 17:51:01,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7527,request/request,2215,EventEmitter memory leak when header option for User Agent is included,This _could_ be a server side issue but it s rather strange because it only happens when sending a custom user agent string using the request module.      var request = require  request  ; var url =  http://www.bigassfans.com/case studies/delphine restaurant/ ;  request       url : url      followRedirect : false      headers:            User Agent :  Mozilla/5.0  Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_4  AppleWebKit/537.36  KHTML  like Gecko  Chrome/50.0.2661.94 Safari/537.36           function error  response  html           console.log response.statusCode ;         console.log response.headers ;   ;       When you run this  notice the response statusCode is 302  which is weird because the Location header in the response is the requested page itself.  If you run this without the User Agent header  it works as expected and you get a 200 OK response.  If you send the User Agent but comment out the  followRedirect : false  option  you get this error  > Warning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 pipe listeners added.

7522,request/request,2220,Avoid leaking callback functions when Agent pools with keepAlive=true,While analyzing some heapdumps I noticed that some callback functions  and all of their closure data  were being kept in memory longer than I expected.  It turns out that if request uses an Agent pool  and the pool keeps sockets around for keepAlive  then the memory is held until the initial connection is closed.    The most obvious leak is the  callback  and  _callback  references.  The agent pool holds onto references to the connection options  and if the callback is in the options it will stay in memory until the socket is removed from the pool.  The other options I removed hold less direct references back to the callbacks.  I ve put a testcase up here: https://gist.github.com/mdlavin/97b4e6755c18cdb8305681fbb6433ac0.  Without the fix below  the output looks like this:      leak changes [   what:  LeakingClass       size_bytes: 240      size:  240 bytes          : 10         : 0   ] leak changes []      Showing that the LeakingClass gets created and never removed from memory.  With the fix  the testcase outputs:      leak changes [   what:  LeakingClass       size_bytes: 240      size:  240 bytes          : 10         : 0   ] leak changes [   what:  LeakingClass       size_bytes:  240      size:   240 bytes          : 0         : 10   ]      Showing that the LeakingClass is created and then released from memory. ,mdlavin,closed,7,2016-05-20 15:46:57,2017-02-22 00:12:49,,abandoned,,,1,1

7520,request/request,2222, gzip: true  not setting  Accept Encoding  header automatically may be more flexible.,On our app  we would like to support gzip only for websites that force it whether you send an  Accept Encoding  header or not. So  our plan was to have a non gzipped communication for sites who support it and gzipped communication with sites who force it  ir order not to get hit by the CPU load gzipping all communication may create.. if it does .  Yet  making  gzip: true  currently adds  Accept Encoding: gzip  header automatically. So  it is an all or none option.  It would have been great if  gzip: true  hadn t added  Accept Encoding: gzip  header automatically but only uncompressed any gzipped responses.  And  if we still need the current behavior  gzipped communication for all requests   adding  Accept Encoding: gzip  manually will do the job.  Just an idea : . ,umutm,open,0,2016-05-25 11:40:27,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

I ve tested this with a 228mb mp4 file using NW 0.15.0 32 bit and request 2.72.0. This problem also occured in NW 0.12.   32 bit with an older request version. This issue seems to occur in Windows XP 32 bit 100  of the time and I ve managed to get the same result in Windows 7 randomly.  I ve created a reproduction environement: _URL removed_  I highly suggest downloading the video manually from _URL removed_ and changing the download URL in index.html to your localhost  eg. http://localhost/large file.mp4  since this greatly speeds up the process of downloading the file and thus  testing. ,ev8dev,open,2,2016-05-31 08:21:22,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7510,request/request,2232,Question about injecting headers in ALL requests,Hi there and thx for this awesome module.  I haven t use it a lot and I was wondering  Instead of adding the headers in every request by hand like the docs.  ex.      var options =     url: myuRL    headers:        header1 :  headerVal         request options  callback ;      Is it possible with a middleware or something to inject the headers in ALL requests?  I tried by creating this middleware:      var cache = require  ../cache   const addHeaders = function  req  res  next      req.header  Authorization   cache.token ;   next  ;  ; module.exports = addHeaders;      It works on all request except those done with the  request  module.

7502,request/request,2240,Remove connectionErrorHandler to fix  1903,The  socket._httpMessage.emit  error   error   line currently throws when the keep alive period expires and the socket resets  after a redirect to a different host. This is because the listener on the socket is never cleaned up  and the socket no longer has _httpMessage  the ClientRequest is long gone . This is bug  1903  which is also responsible for npm/npm 9984.  It looks to me like node core correctly re emits socket error events on _httpMessage now  so we shouldn t have to.

7484,request/request,2258,Add Force ipv6 option similar to curl,The request module seems to be only making requests using ipv4. In curl I can add a  6 flag to use ipv6. ,laplaceon,open,2,2016-06-23 19:54:30,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1
7483,request/request,2259,Timeout when uploading,It seems that if one uses timeout options  for example 30 seconds  and I use request to upload with POST a large body which takes longer than 30 seconds to upload  a timeout error is thrown  despite uploading being happening and intervals between chunks of upload body being smaller than 30 seconds. It seems timeout code assumes that sending a request will always happen before the timeout  which works for small requests but not large.  It would be great if timeout would simply work in both directions the same. So timeout should happen only if there was no sending or receiving of a chunk for 30 seconds. ,mitar,open,0,2016-06-23 21:56:24,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7481,request/request,2261,request is super slow to require,    Description   const request = require  request     takes 100 to 150ms to execute  on Linux . Whereas [needle] https://www.npmjs.com/package/needle   a similar library  only takes 20 to 25ms. I haven t tested needle s require time on Windows  but request s require time clocked in at around 800ms on Windows 7  which is pretty ridiculous. The time to require a module may not be an issue for a lot of applications  but it _is_ a concern for [electron] http://electron.atom.io/docs/  apps. For example  if I were to build an electron app that called some api  my app s startup time would take an automatic hit of around 100ms just to require in request  and even longer on Windows . Any delay [longer than 100ms] https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response times 3 important limits/  is felt by a user  so right of the bat  my application loses any chance at being perceived as fast.  I ve been working around this by using node s archaic http module  but I m at a point where its increasingly hard for me to escape request. It is so damn popular. Basically any npm module that talks to a server uses request under the hood and consequently inherits request s slow require time.     Steps to Reproduce      js console.time  time to require   const request = require  request   console.timeEnd  time to require           Going Forward  Can we bring down request s require time  at least to needle s levels ? ,ttmarek,open,8,2016-06-26 03:56:33,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features  fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.  I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint. Given that you have a decent test suite  a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.  Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn t right?

7457,request/request,2285,Module does not resume/recover from network loss mid get request,We are using the request@2.52.0 module to download files from a node server. This has also been tested on request@2.73.0  We are using file streaming from the node server and we are also streaming the response to a file  If we loose connection mid download the module gets stuck and never finishes. We are running a synchronous application and there for it stops working when the request module gets stuck.  I wrote a test code which you should be able to use to test this.      //for server install restify and throttle npm i restify npm i throttle //for client install request npm i request      server code      js     var restify = require  restify  ;     var throttle = require  throttle  ;     var fs = require  fs  ;     var server = restify.createServer  ;      server.use restify.bodyParser   ;     server.use restify.queryParser   ;      server.get  /server   function req res         res.send 200   This is the correct server  ;             server.get  /download   function req res         var trott = new throttle 512 ;       fs.createReadStream  fileUpload/file.dat  .pipe trott .pipe res ;       ;      server.listen 3000  function           console.log  Download Server listening  ;       ;      client code      js     var request = require  request  ;     var fs = require  fs  ;    // require  request debug   request ;     var reqObj =         url:  http:// url :3000/download         headers:         ;      request.get reqObj .on  response   function response         if response.statusCode === 200           console.log  got file  ;         var output = fs.createWriteStream  fileDownload/file.dat  ;         response.pipe output ;         output.on  finish   function                        console.log  finished writing file  ;           ;          output.on  error   function error             console.log  write error:    error.message ;           ;                  .on  error   function error         console.log  request error:    error.message ;       ;      Request Debug output      js   request:       debugId: 1       uri:  http:// host :3000/download        method:  GET        headers:   host:   host :3000          response:       debugId: 1       headers:          date:  Fri  15 Jul 2016 14:24:36 GMT           connection:  close            transfer encoding :  chunked          statusCode: 200          How to recreate  Deploy the server code to a remote server and create a file of size x      dd if=/dev/zero of=file.dat bs=1M count=250 //250M size      Run the client code on your desktop and turn off your internet adapted for more than 10 minutes.  I used a ubuntu virtual machine and turned off the  Enable Networking   When internet connection is resumed the module gets stuck and never finished the pipe and therefor the code in the output.on  finish   function is never run.  There the callback is called in our application   If the internet connection is dropped for less that 10 minutes the output finish function is called but does not finish download the file. This scenario is okay for me because this will initiate a redownload.  The deadlock we have when the output finish function is never called is a big problem for us. ,Sigurthorb,open,0,2016-07-15 15:20:28,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7455,request/request,2287,Make  arrayFormat:  brackets   a default stringify option,[Over on  qs   repo] https://github.com/ljharb/qs/issues/107   I and some others have identified an ambiguity in query string parsing that may be particularly problematic with [ request  and  express ] https://github.com/ljharb/qs/issues/107 issuecomment 233094445 . This ambiguity may be resolved on the  express  side by parsing all problematic querystrings [as objects] https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/3039   but to preserve the developer s intent to serializing an _array_  the  arrayFormat  needs to here be made something that can be parsed unambiguously: either   brackets   or   repeat  .   qs   maintainer has signaled his [preference for   brackets  ] https://github.com/ljharb/qs/issues/107 issuecomment 233110210  and that this may be made the default in the next version of  qs . As a stopgap  would you consider making this a default [here] https://github.com/request/request/blob/473cae3c89683885de2c6b73c2a7c3b4c43ce56a/lib/querystring.js L22 ?  It would probably need to be a breaking change  but I suspect it would inconvenience few developers since the current version of  qs   as used by  express   will parse   brackets   format as arrays no problem; and [  .param ] http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/  also serializes arrays using   brackets   format  so other web frameworks are probably used to handling that format. ,wearhere,open,5,2016-07-16 06:48:25,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features  fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.  I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of hawk. Given that you have a decent test suite  a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.  Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn t right?

7446,request/request,2296,Making an HTTP request to a named pipe on Windows,Node.js provides opening a listening socket on a named pipe  both on Windows and on Linux. See:   https://nodejs.org/api/http.html http_server_listen_path_callback   https://nodejs.org/api/net.html net_server_listen_path_backlog_callback  For this  I use the express module to open a listening socket like so:      JavaScript var express = require  express  ; var path = require  path  ; var app = express  ; app.get  /:id   function req  res      console.log req.params.id ;   ; var pipe = path.join      ?  pipe   process.cwd     myctl  ; app.listen pipe  function       console.log  Listening...  ;   ;      This seems to work as sysinternal s processexplorer tells that the Node process is indeed opening handles to that named pipe.  However  it does not seem like the request module supports making HTTP requests to a named pipe:      JavaScript var pipe = path.join      ?  pipe   process.cwd     myctl  ; var request = require  request  ; request.get pipe ;       gives  Invalid URI  error .  whereas using net.socket the following works  results in the /:id route being taken on the server :      JavaScript var pipe = path.join      ?  pipe   process.cwd     myctl  ; var sock = require  net  .Socket  ; sock.connect  path: pipe   function       sock.write  GET /1 r n r n  ;   sock.end  ;   ;      Another question I have is: Is it possible to provide an already configured net.socket to the request module  or does request always try to open its own socket? ,httpdigest,open,0,2016-07-23 12:43:57,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1
7445,request/request,2297,Document request.pause   and request.resume  ,In my search to find an efficient way to use  request  to only pipe status 200 responses to files  the only decent solution I found involved using  request.pause    and  request.resume   . SO describes this solution here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/26163128/650894. I also plan to use this solution to block against initiating downloads of files exceeding a certain length.  Because  .pause    and  .resume    are not documented in the readme  I worry that you devs may not feel bound to continue supporting them or to maintain backward compatibility. It would be nice to see these documented  both to help others who find themselves with similar problems and to give us a warm and fuzzy about dev commitment to these methods.

7431,request/request,2311,Request  HTTP/2  and Node.js Core,Hello request team   I am currently heading up an effort to explore whether and how to implement HTTP/2 support directly in Node.js core. The question of If we should do this is still open. To help answer that question  as well as determine the best course forward should we decide to move ahead  I would love to get input from each of you with regards to what would be the best approach from the Request point of view.   If this repo is not the correct place to discuss this  then please accept my apologies. I ll gladly move the conversation over to wherever you prefer it.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features  fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.  I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint. Given that you have a decent test suite  a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.  Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn t right?

Further  you can detect whether the timeout was a connection timeout by checking if the err.connect property is set to true.

7415,request/request,2327,Malformed host header when accessing a docker daemon,This may not be a bug in request  and I would be happy to report it to the docker team if that is the case. The thing is that after upgrading to the latest version of docker  1.12   when I tried to connect to the daemon using unix domain sockets  I got the error: 400 Bad Request: malformed Host header   I noticed that the host header sent by request was:  /var/run/docker.sock   On the other hand  using curl it worked well  and the request looked like this:        curl  v   unix socket /var/run/docker.sock http:/version     Trying /var/run/docker.sock...   Connected to http  /var/run/docker.sock  port 80   0  > GET /version HTTP/1.1 > Host: http > User Agent: curl/7.47.0 > Accept:  /  > < HTTP/1.1 200 OK < Content Type: application/json < Server: Docker/1.12.0  linux  < Date: Fri  12 Aug 2016 13:14:44 GMT < Content Length: 198      And by overriding the host header  I also got request working:      js request  url:  http://unix:/var/run/docker.sock:/version   headers: host:  http     function err  response  body  ...        Could it be that request is not setting the host header correctly?  ,manast,open,6,2016-08-12 13:21:45,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features  fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.  I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint. Given that you have a decent test suite  a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project.

7411,request/request,2331,Feature: option to enforce specific status code response,After many years of building and using request there s one piece of boiler that still really bugs me.      javascript request.get  /    err  resp  body  =>     if  err  throw err   if  resp.statusCode  == 200  throw new Error  Status code is not 200    resp.statusCode    // ^^ THIS LINE IS SUPER LONG AND ANNOYING ^^         It would be great if we have a feature to specify the   required    status code that would create and pass an error if it does not pass.      markdown    options.status  Specify the a required status code. If the condition is not met an error is passed  to the callback  or emitted if there is no callback .  If the option is an integer that will be the only acceptable status code. If  the option is a the status code is matched against the expression.      Thoughts? ,mikeal,open,1,2016-08-13 21:48:06,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7409,request/request,2333,how to set highWaterMark,Hello   I was wondering how to set highWaterMark on a stream with request? I have seen this is possible with the body option like here: https://github.com/request/request/blob/473cae3c89683885de2c6b73c2a7c3b4c43ce56a/tests/test stream.js  However this is a local stream used and I am using a remote stream. I don t know how to set a highWaterMark since I would like to reduce it in order to buffer less data than the default value reported here: https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html stream_implementing_a_readable_stream  Thanks in advance for your help. ,iiAku,open,1,2016-08-15 17:43:32,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features  fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.  I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint. Given that you have a decent test suite  a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.  Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn t right?

Here s the repro script:      JavaScript var request = require  request  ; request  http://registry.npmjs.org/ /all   function  error  response  body      console.log  before  ;   console.log response ;   console.log  after  ;   ;      If I try to use the error or body object from the callback  everything works as expected. But trying to use the response object leads to the error.  In fact this is the simplest repro case that we have. In fact issue is reproducible without console.log of the response  when there are a lot of callbacks chained  in our case we are passing the arguments from request callback to other callbacks  which call other callbacks  etc. and the process exits.  Do you have any idea what s causing this? Maybe it s related to Nodejs memory management  I m not sure what s going on here. ,rosen-vladimirov,open,1,2016-08-22 11:34:03,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

Cookie:facebook.com Request:null,I m looping through a JSON array of cookies and adding them like so:      let cookies = []; cookies.push new ToughCookie.Cookie       key: cookie.name      domain:  .facebook.com       value: cookie.value      secure: cookie.secure    false      path: cookie.path      httpOnly: cookie.httpOnly    false      extensions: extensions    ;      I later set them like so  using request.cookieJar :      cookieJar.setCookie cookie   .facebook.com    err  cookie  =>       if err            reject new Error err  ;         return;               When making a request I am getting the following error:      Unhandled rejection Error: Error: Cookie not in this host s domain. Cookie:facebook.com Request:null      The documentation is not very good on how to set this up. I could get this to work by removing the  domain   and using  https://facebook.com  when setting the cookie. But  this is useless as this means other requests can not be made to endpoints such as  upload.facebook.com .  The cookies all contain  domain=.facebook.com .  How do I set the cookies and add them to the cookie jar properly so that they work across subdomains. ,JamesTheHacker,closed,1,2016-08-25 11:42:32,2016-08-25 13:16:48,,,,0,1
7396,request/request,2346,Progress event,This completes my programs requirements  but as I m not familiar with all of the ins and outs of  request   I m sure I m missing some other point where a progress event might make sense.  At the moment it:      Adds a transferred property to the  Request  object to track bytes sent.       During the  write  operation  it will emit a  progress  event that includes the standard  ProgressEvent  object as defined in the [ProgressEvent spec] https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/ interface progressevent .  Again  due to my unfamiliarity with the code base  and being the first time I ve used  tape  tests  I would say my test cases are pretty minimal and permissive  so I definitely welcome some direction from the team on that.

7393,request/request,2349,Check error type instead of string,Upstream change broke this unit test. Fixed this in another PR and realized that it s probably better off as it s own PR.   form data  just released 1.0.0  and it changed the order of property lookup what triggers a  TypeError  when we push up a null form data property. This change just checks that it throws a  TypeError  instead of checking the string.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features  fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.  I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint. Given that you have a decent test suite  a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features  fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.  I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of karma tap. Given that you have a decent test suite  a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.  Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn t right? Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?  There is a collection of [frequently asked questions] https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html  and while I m just a bot  there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things.

7387,request/request,2355,Pipeing and modify callback response,Hey guys   This is more of a question. I m pipeing one request and doing the decoding myself like this:      javascript   // decodes   .on  response   function resp       var charset = extractCharsetFromStr resp.headers[ content type ]           encoding = resp.headers[ content encoding ]          decodedRes;      // unzip     if encoding ==  gzip     encoding ==  deflate         decodedRes = resp.pipe encoding ==  gzip  ? zlib.createGunzip   : zlib.createInflate        else       decodedRes = resp      // charset     if charset  =  utf 8     iconv.encodingExists charset          return decodedRes.pipe iconv.decodeStream charset                   But this is not modifying the response body in the callback  request      err  resp  =>       my question is  if I listen to the  data  and  finish  event and buffer the body myself  will request still buffer the body on it s on if I don t pass the callback? I don t want to hold two objects like these in memory. ,lucaswxp,open,0,2016-08-29 13:31:29,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1
7386,request/request,2356,empty post data with example from doc,One of the most essential features of such a library is ability to just send post data.

Sometimes it timeouts once  sometimes it timeouts 2 out of 3 retries and sometimes it will timeout 3 times  all 3 retries . This is not fault of the destination server because I ve tested same route from different application written in Go at the same time and i get response in 2ms  no timeouts.   ,devlo,open,2,2016-09-01 08:39:02,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7379,request/request,2363,Adding interceptors to request,I m wondering if it s possible to add some sort of interception mechanism  kind of like middleware for express  to request  for things such as logging  caching  authentication  etc.  We ve been using request promise for a while now in our applications and are very pleased with it. However  in order to reuse logic for things like authentication  we ve had to wrap request promise in our own custom library  we call  endpoints   to add interception like behavior.  Ideally we d be able to add interceptors to request directly. Is there a chance this would be something that could be added? I myself would be willing to do the work to add this but would need some guidance from someone more familiar with the code base.  Ideally  the interceptor would look something like this  this is an oversimplified example  but is useful for illustrating how I think it might work :      var rp          = require  request promise  ;     interceptor = require  ./mylogginginterceptor.js  ;  rp.use interceptor   ;  rp  https://www.anendpoint.com  ;      Then the interceptor could look something like:      module.exports = function options        return function req  next  cb            // do some logging of the request         next req  function err  res                // do some logging of the response             cb err  res ;           ;      ;        Does this seem useful? ,afrasso,open,3,2016-09-02 18:42:17,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7353,request/request,2389,How to read same key headers from a response?,Hello   First of all thanks for this amazing module    Here is the issue:   After a get request I want to read two header fields called with the same key:  set cookie   I know this by inspecting the response headers in chrome s debugger.  The problem is that  when using this module  in the response headers only one appears since  I believe  it s an object already processed which doesnt allow to have same key fields.  So how do I get hold of two response headers with the same key?  Thanks    PD:  if I inspect the jar with getCookies   i get an empty array so that s not a solution. Which is also weird since before  that is  when the page I was crawling returned just one cookie for each key in the header  it worked fine and gave me an array with length > 0. ,miguelalche,open,2,2016-09-21 14:22:47,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1
7352,request/request,2390,Wrong percent encoding for reserved URI character,As defined in the RFC  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 section 2.2  the character Apostrophe     is a reserved character and therfore should not be percent encoded when sending a http request. I went into an issue sending a request with the following path:   /api/Things  1234     because It was encoded into   /api/Things  271234 27    which cannot be handled by the backend.  As you see the paranthesis are not encoded because they are a reserved character. So encoding the Apostrophe is definetly a bug.  Btw the http.request method does not percent encode the Apostrophe. ,gecko17,open,1,2016-09-22 10:13:41,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

Any guess how I can force it to use plain http? Thanks ,hamxabaig,closed,9,2016-09-30 18:09:19,2016-09-30 18:12:45,,,,0,1

7337,request/request,2405,There is no simple way to change the port of a baseUrl,As [described in the README] https://github.com/request/request user content requestoptions callback   the  baseUrl  option can be used in combination with  request.defaults  to make many requests to the same domain.  This is a very useful feature when making a consumer of an API that has a lot of endpoints with the same base URL. These kind of API s are often consumed through a wrapper library for the API  and these wrapper libraries mostly have a lot of configurable options. These options typically include some kind of  port  option to specify on which port the API is running.  It s arguable that this  port  option is a bad idea  and the port should be specified in some url instead following [RFC 3986] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 section 3.2.3   but for a lot of API wrappers that means breaking their interface.  The only way for an API to  override  the port of a  request.defaults  object s  baseUrl  is by doing string manipulation and url parsing  which is tedious  error prone and not very performant  and it s kind of stupid since both node s [http] https://nodejs.org/api/http.html http_http_createclient_port_host  and [https] https://nodejs.org/api/https.html https_https_request_options_callback  modules allow to easily set the port.  It would be nice to have a way to more easily overwrite the port of a  request.defaults  object for use in API wrappers. ,seppestas,open,0,2016-10-06 12:56:08,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

If you want any of these commits parted out into separate PRs  let me know.  I have tested these commits on Travis many times now and each time all 4 node targets have been green  so I am fairly confident not only about  tests/test timeout.js   but also flaky tests in  tests/test pipes.js   and other random failures.  One possibly  major  change included here is the change in timeout behavior. IMHO the timeout changes  in request.js  I ve provided here more accurately reflect the intended behavior. ,mscdex,closed,3,2016-10-14 01:06:09,2016-10-20 07:49:57,,,,1,1

I took a heap snapshot  and it looked like there were 1000   connect  listeners on a TLS socket  holding on to other memory as a result.  It seems like the  connect  listener on a socket might not be removed if there is a timeout connecting in the new timeout implementation.

7292,request/request,2450,Make documentation clearer on acceptable values for json property,The documentation is currently not clear what values can be passed to JSON  and what the values of other fields should be based on JSON s value. According to the documentation for the  body  option:    >    body    entity body for PATCH  POST and PUT requests. Must be a  Buffer    String  or  ReadStream . If  json  is  true   then  body  must be a JSON serializable object.    This implies that  json  is a boolean field; all the examples show  json  being populated with  true .   However  unit tests show that  json  can also be populated with an object.      EDIT: unit tests not found  maybe this was historical behavior that was silently deprecated?   EDIT2: code handling  json  as non boolean value [here][code example]    The documentation for  json  only says:    >    json    sets  body  to JSON representation of value and adds  Content type: application/json  header.  Additionally  parses the response body as JSON.    But doesn t say what  sets  means exactly. It would be good to clarify exactly what s acceptable for this field  and what happens in the various cases.  For example     >    json      when set to  true     sets  body  to JSON representation of value and adds  Content type: application/json  header.  Additionally  parses the response body as JSON.   When set to an object ...      It s also not clear on what happens to  form  when  json  is used  either as a boolean or object. In general  it s not clear what the behavior is when  form  and  body  are specified together.     Apologies in advance if this is already documented somewhere that I missed.

7290,request/request,2452,Adds .timings array with DNC  TCP  request and response times,This improves upon https://github.com/request/request/pull/1459 by adding a timings breakdown for the following phases:      DNS    TCP    Request    Download    First  instead of relying on  new Date  .getTime    we can use  process.hrtime    to get a higher resolution monotonically non decreasing timestamp.  This is utilized via the [ performance now ] https://github.com/myrne/performance now  package.    The previous PR tracked  startTime   not exposed  and  elapsedTime   exposed on the request .  This PR adds a new  .timings  object that adds new timestamps and elapsed times.    Note the  timestamps  in this object are not Unix epoch based like  new Date.getTime       they are  milliseconds.microsecond  resolution relative to when the  performance now  module got loaded.    If there is a redirect when fetching the resource  the timestamps are only for the final resource fetched.    Timestamps:       start : Timestamp when  request    was initialized     socket  Timestamp when the [ http ] https://nodejs.org/api/http.html http_event_socket  module s  socket  event fires.  This happens when the socket is assigned to the request  after DNS has been resolved .     connect : Timestamp when the [ http ] https://nodejs.org/api/http.html http_event_connect  module s  connect  event fires.  This happens when the server acknowledges the TCP connection.     response : Timestamp when the [ http ] https://nodejs.org/api/http.html http_event_response  module s  response  event fires.  This happens when the first bytes are received from the server.     end : Timestamp when the last bytes of the response are received.

7278,request/request,2464,request content type is removed from request header and body is deleted when redirecting ,The content type and body are removed from the header when redirecting. I use the content type with other header values to create authorization header. The destination server recreates the authorization using the same set of header values  Obviously the original authorization value doesn t match with the value calculated at the server side because the content type is removed when redirected. What is the reason removing the content type and body when redirecting?           if  response.statusCode  == 401    response.statusCode  == 307         // Remove parameters from the previous response  unless this is the second request      // for a server that requires digest authentication.      delete request.body      delete request._form      if  request.headers           request.removeHeader  host          request.removeHeader  content type          request.removeHeader  content length          if  request.uri.hostname  == request.originalHost.split  :  [0]             // Remove authorization if changing hostnames  but not if just          // changing ports or protocols .

7274,request/request,2468,Multipart/related POST request breaks if passed stream throws an error,We noticed that it is impossible to catch an error from passed stream that is multipart chunk. It seems that if  after resuming the stream inside request  stream throws an error  it crashes the application  as the error is not caught by any event listener and cannot be handled then.    Steps to reproduce:  1. Create a stream  that will throw an error after opening  in our case: http stream returning 404   2. Pass the stream as multipart data:       const options =       method:  POST      json: true     encoding: null     uri: someURI     multipart:      [    Content ID :  <metadata>            Content Type :  application/json           body: someString             Content ID :  <content>            Content Type :  application/octet stream           body: streamHere   ]         3. Start issuing a request:     request options ;       We tried attaching multiple different event emitters to the request and to the stream directly  specifically    error  ones   but still   it seems like error thrown from the stream is unhandled and could break the app.    Just as POC   we commented out  request  part completely and tried consuming the stream in the code   it was properly handled and all the event listeners were called as expected  including  error  listener in particular .,SzybkiSasza,open,0,2016-11-21 14:17:12,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7264,request/request,2478,Memory Leak in Streaming,This might be a known issue.  I ve noticed a significant leak when using  request  to stream video.     The quick workaround is to undefine the callback when receiving a response.       function createStream options  callback       const requestStream = request options  error =>  error ? callback error  : undefined        .once  response    response  =>          // A bug in  request  causes a memory leak if a callback is defined        requestStream.callback = undefined;        callback undefined  response ;        ;          All memory is released once the request is aborted. That makes it more relevant when streaming for longer duration.  If anyone is interested  I also have a simple  tape  test that reproduces the issue. Running the test will cause a  300 MB leak in 10 seconds. The leak is slower when streaming live video  depending on the bit rate .,tomergg,open,2,2016-12-02 00:37:33,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7254,request/request,2488,Request contains both content length and  Transfer Encoding :  chunked ,Hi     I came across an issue using request version 2.79.0.  I want to sent a multipart request containing two elements  the first is a json object with known length  the second is a stream of unknown length.  Therefore I set  Transfer Encoding :  chunked  in the request options:         var options =        method:  PUT        uri:  http://localhost:9002/api/store/...        formData:          metadata: JSON.stringify metadata          content: part // a stream              headers:           Transfer Encoding :  chunked                  However  the server I m sending the data to raises an Error    [Error: Parse Error] bytesParsed: 1628  code:  HPE_UNEXPECTED_CONTENT_LENGTH   .   This is because request internally adds a content length header to the http request. If  Transfer Encoding :  chunked  is set in the options then request must not add a content length header.    I did some debugging and found the code that sets the header  it s in request.js line 575:  self.setHeader  content length   length    If I uncomment this line  then everything works just fine.  I guess that the code needs an additional check to anly set content length if no  Transfer Encoding :  chunked  is specified.      This is the output of request debug. There you can see that both headers  Transfer Encoding  and  content length  are set:              request:        debugId: 2       uri:  http://localhost:9002/api/store/1.1/file/environment/project1_p/zips/2a0d2a70 c210 11e6 a963 b964c3706543.zip        method:  PUT        headers:           Transfer Encoding :  chunked          authorization:  Bearer myToken           x request id :  631613F8 4BAC 4A00 B892 FDA0A2EA3A1D          host:  localhost:9002           content type :  multipart/form data; boundary=                          290886497940693959155150           content length : 499                          I m not sure if this is the only relevant line of code  as content length header is set at many different code blocks.

7253,request/request,2489,There is bias of callback if error occured in request,Generally speaking  we have to keep consistence when call the callback in code which means a callback should be called always in async way. let s see the code below:       javascript  function asyncFunc options  callback        callback  ;       asyncFunc   => console.log  Second   ;  console.log  First  ;         what do we expect is:       First  Second         but we got:       Second  First         Let s make a bit changes:     javascript  function asyncFunc options  callback        if ...            http.get options callback ;       else           callback  ;              asyncFunc   => console.log  Second   ;  console.log  First  ;         What does the result look like? We don t know  But the principal of a  callback   should be called asynchronously  in this way  we keep the API consistency to developer. When it comes to the  request  module  same problem exists. Let simplify the code:       javascript  function request options  callback        self.on  error   self.callback.bind   ;      // do some merge and parsing things here...      if  typeof self.baseUrl  ==  string           // this will be executed synchronously         return self.emit  error   new Error  options.baseUrl must be a string   ;               self.req = http.request options callback ;      self.req.on  error   self.callback.bind   ; //  this will be executed asynchronously       request options   e res =>       if e            return console.log  Second  ;       else           //...           ;    console.log  First  ;         What we expect the output of above code is:       First  Second       But if there is something error with  baseUrl   we ll get  Second  immediately  that s not what we want. So I suggest that the code should be:       javascript  function request options  callback        self.on  error   self.callback.bind   ;      // do some merge and parsing things here...      if  typeof self.baseUrl  ==  string              // this will be executed synchronously           return process.nextTick function                 self.emit  error   new Error  options.baseUrl must be a string   ;            ;               self.req = http.request options callback ;      self.req.on  error   self.callback.bind   ; //  this will be executed asynchronously            What do you think of it? @simov @mscdex ,mike442144,open,0,2016-12-15 12:15:44,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7251,request/request,2491,Expose setting to utilize  dns.resolve  automatically instead of falling back to  dns.lookup ,In a normal scenario if you do a  request.get  http://www.foo.com    Node will perform a  dns.lookup  on  www.foo.com . This is an asynchronous task in the Node event loop  but it utilizes a synchronous libuv thread. This is called out in the DNS docs  https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html dns_dns_lookup.    You can see why this matters by looking at the following Node github issue  https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/8436  and my comment on that issue at  https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/8436 issuecomment 268322327 .    Unless you utilize a custom flag  the libuv thread pool is only 4 deep. This means if you do 4 dns.lookups which are delayed for some reason  the entirety of anything governed by libuv is blocked until those returned. This means any IO is blocked until those dns requests resolve  which is really hard to debug since the Node event loop will be healthy  but IO requests will never complete.    Now  this entire operation is avoidable if  dns.resolve    is used instead of  dns.lookup   . From my tests  dns.resolve    ignores  /etc/hosts  but still utilizes  /etc/resolv.conf . So my suggestion would be expose a setting  which when passed  dnsResolve : true  then it will take the URL passed  extract the hostname  execute a dns.resolve on it  then alter the url to be by IP and pass a host header with the original value. In example  request.get  http://www.google.com/test/    would be converted under the hood to request.get  http://172.217.4.132/test/     headers :   host :  www.google.com      . All in all it s a fairly easy operation to make  and is essential for our use case. We would be willing to submit a pull request to get it into  request  if you believe it could be of value.,owenallenaz,open,3,2016-12-20 22:40:19,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1
7250,request/request,2492,More lenient gzip decompression,Be explicitly lenient with gzip decompression by always requesting   zlib  to flush the input data and never explicitly ending the   zlib  input.    The behavioural difference is that on Node   6  which has a slightly  stricter gzip decoding process than previous Node versions  malformed  but otherwise acceptable server responses are still properly  decompressed  the most common example being a missing checksum  at the stream end .    This aligns behaviour with cURL  which always uses the  Z_SYNC_FLUSH   flag for decompression.

7249,request/request,2493,Fix Deprecation warning,Hello     I ve noticed a WARN message when installing dependencies of this module   npm WARN deprecated node uuid@1.4.7: use uuid module instead     Thanks for the great work     Michael,MichaelTSS,open,3,2016-12-21 14:15:36,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1
7248,request/request,2494,Calling GET to domain with .php in between seems to be returning 400 bad request,I can call directly in my browser to a url like this:    https://[username]:[password]@api.bamboohr.com/api/gateway.php/visioncritical/v1/employees/changed?since=2016 12 20T23 3A46 3A53Z    This will return some results on screen.  However  when I call it using   request.get [Same domain] ;    This is always returning status 404.  I couldn t figure out why except suspecting it has something to do with the structure of the url  e.g say having .php in between ?   Is it possible that there is a defect in request module for not supporting url in such format?,phoebs85,open,5,2016-12-22 00:21:44,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1
7247,request/request,2495,Add CORS support?,Have you thought of adding CORS support. I m using the  request  package to test a backend server and I m trying to send CORS requests and thought it would be nice if you could enable CORS functionality and I didn t have to take care of sending the  OPTIONS  request before each request I want to execute.,eliOcs,closed,1,2016-12-22 08:15:53,2016-12-22 09:13:04,,,,0,1
7246,request/request,2496,GATEWAY_TIMEOUT doesn t return err or body in callback  just request,When using the  request options   err  response  body  =>     syntax and a  GATEWAY_TIMEOUT  error occurs  neither the  err  or  body  parameters are supplied to the callback  just the response parameter. This makes for an inconsistent developer API.

7232,request/request,2510,Error is not getting propagated to consumers of request,Code is here : https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/request.js L188    Because of the above referenced line of code  the actual errors in making the HTTP request are not known by the code using  request . The caller just gets an error event with no other information. Is there some reason / rationale behind this? Isn t it better to give the consumer all the available information about the cause of the error so that appropriate error handling is done?    If somebody does not want all that info  they can very easily ignore that. Am I missing something?    How this affected me :      I am using the  node gcm  package which uses  request  to make the HTTP request. The authentication key is passed to  node gcm  as an option from my code which then gets passed as an header to  request . That key had a   n  at its end and the core http implementation of nodejs does not allow that and raises an  Exception .     request  catches that here https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/request.js L745 and emits an  error  event with the actual error object  but then it gets swallowed by the code specified at the beginning of this issue.

7201,request/request,2541,Add convenience method for HTTP OPTIONS,Hey guys     I m currently working on a feature that involves a HTTP OPTIONS request. I really appreciate the convenience methods as they are easy to stub with my library of choice  Sinon .    I noticed that there is not an equivalent for HTTP OPTIONS  so I ve added one. There may be a reason why this hasn t been exposed already  but implementing it didn t impact any of the existing tests  plus searching the existing PRs and issues didn t suggest anything.    My PR also has new version number  i.e. new minor revision   but this is merely a suggestion; I m sure you ll have your own processes surrounding this.    Let me know if you have any questions or thoughts.    Thanks   James,jamesseanwright,closed,7,2017-02-14 12:47:58,2017-04-17 23:40:40,,,,1,1

7196,request/request,2546,A couple of  issues  on digest authentication implementation,Hi     more than real issues these are potential improvements to current implementation of digest authentication...    Background: we have a server that uses digest auth because  due to some contraints on the network connection between server and client  we cannot fully protect for MitM attacks  and consequently we cannot use basic auth.    As far as I understand  current implementation in request is that  when setting the immediately parameter to false  it first sends a non authenticated request and then  when the server requests digest  it sends the digest authenticated request. The problem with this implementation is that a MitM may intercept the initial request and sets authentication required to basic rather than digest  effectively  downgrading  teh authentication and intercepting the credentials.    A potential solution would be controlling through an additional field in the auth parameter object which authentication mechanisms are allowed in the second request  so basic authentication can be fully disabled.    There is also a potential improvement: currently for every request that wants to use digest auth  two http requests must be sent: one non authenticated and then the one authenticated with digest. It would be possible to keep the parameters from the previous digest authentication  including new nonce ...  and try to use them to authenticate directly for succesive requests.    I am looking at the code  and I think that both improvements are not difficult to implement. If you think they make sense  I can make a pull request once I have the changes ready    tx,albertsuchvi,open,1,2017-02-16 10:35:29,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1
7195,request/request,2547,Improvements in digest authentication support,As I mentioned in issue  2546  there are a couple of improvements in the implementation of digest authentication:    1.  have a mechanism to make sure that digest authentication is used:  What I did is adding a new  optional  parameter to the auth   method that can disable the use of specific authorization methods when sendImmediately is set to false. With this parameter  teh caller can disable  for example  basic and bearer authentication  thus ensuring that only digest authentication is used.     2.  optimize the use of digest authentication when consecutive requests are issued  I added a new class variable to Auth to store the information from the previous sent digest authentication. When a new request with sendImmediately=false is sent  and if there was a previous digest authentication sent  it tries to send dircetly a new digest auithentication using the parameters  qop  nonce  cnonce  seq ...  from the revious one. If the request does not work due to baud authentication  the currently implemented mechanism if resending the request with teh authentication required by the server will work.    ,albertsuchvi,closed,1,2017-02-17 10:20:03,2017-02-17 10:29:56,,,,1,1

7177,request/request,2565,Error when consuming stream from http.IncommingMessage of on  response   response  ,    Summary    When you use the http.IncommingMessage from the  on  response   response   as a stream  and combine that with timeouts or promises  you get a partially consumed stream.    It seems that someone is already consuming the stream  so if you delay yourself a bit  you get partially consumed stream. If you don t delay yourself  you are fine.        Simplest Example to Reproduce    This examples tries several scenarios y prints the first lines of each example.    The scenarios are:     Use promise AND use request response as a stream     Use promise AND use http.IncommingMessage as a stream     Use timeout AND use http.IncommingMessage as a stream     Don t delay AND use http.IncommingMessage as a stream    First   Last example work ok  the other two fail.       js  const request = require  request  ;  const   Writable   = require  stream  ;  const chalk = require  chalk  ;    class ToString extends Writable      constructor          super  ;      this.result =   ;           _write chunk  encoding  callback         this.result  = chunk.toString  ;      callback  ;            function stringifyStream stream       const sink = new ToString  ;    stream.pipe sink ;      sink.on  error    err  => console.log  something went bad with sink   err  ;    stream.on  error    err  => console.log  something went bad with stream   err  ;    return new Promise resolve =>        stream.on  end      =>          resolve sink.result ;        ;      ;         const sample =  name  inputStream  =>      return stringifyStream inputStream       .then res =>          console.log chalk.green   nBEGIN Sample:     name    ;        console.log res.split   n  .slice 0  6 .join   n   ;        ;   ;    function withPromise fn  thenFn       return  new Promise fn  .then thenFn ;       withPromise     resolve => request.get  http://nodejs.org/dist/index.json  .on  response   resolve      response => sample  request.js   WITH promise   on response   response    ;    withPromise     resolve => resolve request.get  http://nodejs.org/dist/index.json        response => sample  request.js   WITH promise   NO on response   response    ;    request.get  http://nodejs.org/dist/index.json  .on  response   response =>      setTimeout    =>        sample  request.js   WITH timeout   on response   response ;       100 ;      ;    request.get  http://nodejs.org/dist/index.json  .on  response    response  =>    sample  NO promise   on response   response  ;               Expected Behavior    All outputs should be the same        Current Behavior    The output when i delay myself is different  the stream is partially consumed  so in this example we have a few lines out of the output.        Possible Solution    Solution  I don t know. The cause I think is that the library is already attach to the original stream and it s consuming it. So if we give it enough time  it consumes everything or a part of the stream.        Context    I needed the original stream since I m using hapi and request to proxy a request. And hapi doesn t like the stream request gives back.

7176,request/request,2566,Timings: Tracks  lookup   adds  wait  time  fixes connection re use,   PR Checklist:    [x] I have run  npm test  locally and all tests are passing.    [x] I have added/updated tests for any new behavior.    [x] If this is a significant change  an issue has already been created where the problem / solution was discussed: Addresses some feedback from https://github.com/request/request/pull/2452       PR Description  Feedback from @mcorb in https://github.com/request/request/pull/2452 found a few items with the new  .timings  object.    Changes:    1. The [ net    lookup  ] https://nodejs.org/api/net.html net_event_lookup  event is now tracked  which is the correct event to track DNS lookup time.  2. There is a new  .timingStart  property that is based on  Date.now   .  3. The  .timings.   timestamps are relative to  .timingStart   using  now    .  4. The  .timings  object now only contains  socket    lookup    connect    response  and  end   moving the durations to  .timingPhases    5.  .timings.start  is no longer needed  since it will always in effect be  0 .  6. The other durations such as  wait    dns    tcp   etc were moved to  .timingPhases .  7. A new  .timingPhases.wait  delta is added  which tracks the time from  start >socket   8. The  .timingPhases.dns  calculation is changed from  start >socket  to  socket >lookup .  9. Documentation was updated to be clearer about the handling of HTTP redirects and for all of the new properties above.  10. For cases of connection re use  the timings would have resulted in  NaN s or negative numbers.  This is resolved by assuming any events  such as  lookup   that did not happen  due to re use  are  filled in  using the timestamp of the previous phase  such as  socket    resulting in a  0  ms delta.  11. Fixes https://github.com/request/request/issues/2575 by not re adding event listeners to Keep Alive sockets  resulting in EventEmitter leak     Here is an example of the current properties:               elapsedTime: 143                  // deprecated    responseStartTime: 1488424737161  // deprecated    timingStart: 1488424737018        // Unix Epoch ms    timings:                          // relative to timingStart       socket: 6.410719000000002        lookup: 7.299280000000001        connect: 46.287758000000004        response: 105.45501300000001        end: 142.975414           timingPhases:                     // durations       wait: 6.410719000000002        dns: 0.8885609999999993        tcp: 38.988478        firstByte: 59.167255000000004        download: 37.52040099999999        total: 142.975414                  Tests have been added.,nicjansma,closed,8,2017-02-28 04:51:26,2017-03-04 23:53:21,,,,1,1

However  this approach does not correctly format IPv6 addresses with the necessary enclosing brackets as  hostname  does not include them.    If you were instead to utilize the  host  portion of the parsed URL instead  you would automatically get the correctly bracketed value  potentially plus the port.  My testing has not shown any case where the port was unnecessarily included in the  host  value so I have also avoided adding extra code to remove the port if deemed unnecessary by   request    though I d be happy to add such if anyone can prove it is needed.,JamesMGreene,closed,8,2017-03-04 02:48:44,2017-03-04 02:54:50,,,,1,1

7160,request/request,2582,Allow to set main content type header with form/formData,When sending a form  you can control the boundary  similarly to the advanced use case of forms from the  README.md :       js  var r = request  uri:  http://service.com/upload   method:  post    function optionalCallback err  httpResponse  body   ...    var form = r.form  ;  form._boundary =  MY BOUNDARY ;  form.append  my_field    my_value  ;  ...         The content type header of the request will be set to   multipart/form data; boundary=MY BOUNDARY  .     However  I need to control the content type  e.g.   multipart/MY TYPE; boundary=MY BOUNDARY  .    This is not possible  although the  form data  package allows for this. Reason is that when the  getHeaders    method of the form object is invoked with an empty/undefined  userHeaders  argument.      form data/lib/form_data  ll. 281ff.       js  FormData.prototype.getHeaders = function userHeaders       var header;    var formHeaders =         content type :  multipart/form data; boundary=    this.getBoundary       ;      for  header in userHeaders         if  userHeaders.hasOwnProperty header            formHeaders[header.toLowerCase  ] = userHeaders[header];                  return formHeaders;   ;           request.js  ll. 571ff       js  if  self._form     self.hasHeader  content length         // Before ending the request  we had to compute the length of the whole form  asyncly    self.setHeader self._form.getHeaders    true     self._form.getLength function  err  length         if   err     isNaN length            self.setHeader  content length   length              end            else      end              A simple solution would be to pass  self.headers  as  usedMembers  argument.

7140,request/request,2602,Failing to get the SSL details when sending multiple requests to same URL ,Hi     I m trying to grab the SSL details of URLs and it works when requesting for multiple unique hosts.    Yet  when requesting for the same host  for some reason  only the certificate for the 1st request returns but not others.    It feels like there is a cache/session that keeps the SSL handshake and doesn t perform.    Here is a code to replicate it:         var request       = require  request      var r = request      url:  https://google.com/      method:  HEAD      gzip: true     followRedirect: false    followAllRedirects: false    ;    r.on  response   function res       certDetails =  res.req.connection.getPeerCertificate       console.log           1st Request            ;    console.log certDetails ;            setTimeout  function        var r = request        url:  https://google.com/        method:  HEAD        gzip: true       followRedirect: false      followAllRedirects: false      ;      r.on  response   function res         certDetails =  res.req.connection.getPeerCertificate    // works      console.log           2nd Request            ;      console.log certDetails ;           5000          The 2nd request is sent 5 seconds later to the same host and it fails to get the certificate details.    Yet  if we keep the 1st host as google.com and the 2nd one as yahoo.com  both are retrieved  as they are unique and possibly not cached . ,umutm,closed,1,2017-03-21 12:35:07,2017-03-23 12:59:52,,,,0,1

There is no way to ensure that digest authentication is the only authentication mechanism that can be used. It is possible for an attacker to do a MitM and  downgrade  teh authentication to basic and thus capturing user credentials.  To address this problem I have added an additional  optional  field to the auth parametrer that can disable specifc authentication mechanisms when setting the immediate parameter to false. Thus  the client app can disable basic  and bearer  authentication. When the server responds with the authenticate header  if the authentication requested is disabled by the client  the request fails with an error.    2.  Reusing cnonces and handling nc  When issuing a request with digest auth  the previous cnonce was not used. The consequence is that every request with digest auth had to perform two http requests  one to get the cnonce  and another to send teh digest authentication data using the new cnonce .   I have improved this keeping the last cnonce and trying to reuse it when a request  to the same server  with immediate set to false is performed. This can reduce the number of http requests actually sent in teh case that several accesses to the same server are perfomed consecutively. This improvement also required ensuring that a different nc is sent with each request containg digest auth.  ,albertsuchvi,closed,1,2017-03-21 15:04:40,2017-03-24 10:05:35,,,,1,1

There is no way to ensure that digest authentication is the only authentication mechanism that can be used. It is possible for an attacker to do a MitM and  downgrade  teh authentication to basic and thus capturing user credentials.  To address this problem I have added an additional  optional  field to the auth parametrer that can disable specifc authentication mechanisms when setting the immediate parameter to false. Thus  the client app can disable basic  and bearer  authentication. When the server responds with the authenticate header  if the authentication requested is disabled by the client  the request fails with an error.    2.  Reusing cnonces and handling nc  When issuing a request with digest auth  the previous cnonce was not used. The consequence is that every request with digest auth had to perform two http requests  one to get the cnonce  and another to send teh digest authentication data using the new cnonce .  I have improved this keeping the last cnonce and trying to reuse it when a request  to the same server  with immediate set to false is performed. This can reduce the number of http requests actually sent in teh case that several accesses to the same server are perfomed consecutively. This improvement also required ensuring that a different nc is sent with each request containg digest auth.  ,albertsuchvi,open,0,2017-03-24 10:10:46,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,1,1

During my test I noticed that the request s body is not propagated in the redirected requests.        Simplest Example to Reproduce  I created a simple express server to test it easily  it s online so you can use it for testing      js  app.use bodyParser.json   ;    app.post  /    req  res  =>      res.writeHead 308          location :  https://body redirect.stamplayapp.com/api/codeblock/v1/run/redirect/show body       ;

7133,request/request,2609,Case sensitive header Strings,Hi     I have found an embedded web server in one of my  IoT  devices  which does not authenticate while using the  request  module inside iobroker.javascript.    The problem is  that request sends the Authorization header field in all lower case letters. I don t know  if it is defined in RFC if the header has to be case sensitive.    Is it possible to change the auth.js file  and maybe also others  to have the Header fields starting with uppercase letters and continuing with lowercase as    Authorization    for example. There are some other examples for this behaviour like the host header and so on.       software           version                                  request            2.79.0    node               4.5.0    npm                3.10.8    Operating System   Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS with kernel 3.16.0 44 generic  59 14.04.1 Ubuntu    Kind regards Uwe  ,lupo9557,closed,3,2017-03-24 17:05:25,2017-03-24 20:57:35,,,,0,1

7124,request/request,2618,Added promises library,   PR Checklist:    Simple doc change       PR Description    Added a tiny promises library I made to follow the official  request  API  as per Node.js convention . Because passing  resolveWithFullResponse: true  to every single of the tests I had in my project didn t make sense  nor making a small library only for my project .    With my library you can do:       js  const request = require  request promises  ;    request ... .then res =>      // ...    ;         I made it to be able to natively retrieve the  response  as per the official  request  interface. Node.js unwritten?  I couldn t find a reference  convention is that the first parameter in callbacks is the error and will be  .catch     and the second parameter is the value and will be passed to  .then   . So passing the third parameter to  .then    IMHO doesn t follow what we are used to.    By using this library  the tests become much simpler:       js  const request = require  request promises  ;    it  works   async    =>      const res = await request  http://localhost:3000/  ;    expect res.statusCode .toBe 200 ;    expect res.body .toBe  Hello     ;    ;         And of course with ES7 you aren t really bothered if what you want is the body  just add a small destruct:       js  const request = require  request promises  ;    it  works   async    =>      const   body   = await request  http://localhost:3000/  ;    expect res.statusCode .toBe 200 ;    expect res.body .toBe  Hello     ;    ;     ,franciscop,open,1,2017-03-29 20:32:52,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,1,1

7115,request/request,2627,OAuth 1.0 Support for HMAC SHA256,    Summary  I would like to ass OAuth support for HMAC SHA256 added. Currently request only supports HMAC SHA1 and RSA SHA1.        Current Behavior  Currently using HMAC SHA256 causes the following exception to be thrown:  Signature method not supported: HMAC SHA256    This should be a supported workflow such that this additional signature method can be used without any errors following the existing process.        Context  I am trying to integrate with an OAuth 1.0a one leg provider who can optionally support HMAC SHA256. They recommend that any integrating partner move towards that since they intend to stop supporting HMAC SHA1 in the future.        References  There is an open issue in the oauth sign repo  [Issue 13] https://github.com/request/oauth sign/issues/13   that looks like it might solve this issue.,kylelaverty,open,0,2017-04-05 17:33:31,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features  fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

7071,request/request,2671,The  transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining  error is not thrown when abort stream connection,I try to handle HTTP stream errors.        Steps to Reproduce  When some error occurred I want to abort response stream using:     js  res.connection.destroy new Error  INVALID_END_OF_STREAM   ;         Below is a simple stream source example.     js  const express = require  express  ;   function           const app0 = express  ;        app0.get  /errdata    req  res  next  =>            let i = 0;          res.setHeader  Transfer Encoding    chunked  ;          res.setHeader  Content type    application/json; charset=utf 8  ;          res.write  [  ;          const descriptor = setInterval                  =>                    if    i > 3                         clearInterval descriptor ;                      console.log new Date     close connection  ;                      // when some error occurred I want to abort response stream                      res.connection.destroy new Error  INVALID_END_OF_STREAM   ;                      return;                                       res.write JSON.stringify  i: i  item: i   ;                  res.write     ;                              1000 ;        ;        app0.listen 1000     => console.log  app0:   1000  ;      ;         The stream consumer is another node process which uses the request library to handle the stream:     js  const xSrc = request  url:  http://localhost:1000/errdata   method:  GET   timeout: 10000  ;  xSrc.on  error    err  =>            console.log  ERROR:    err ;              .on  data    chunk  =>            console.log  CHUNK:    chunk.toString  .length ;              .on  end      =>            console.log  END  ;        ;             Expected Behavior  I expect to see something like below since response stream is not closed properly:       > CHUNK: xx  > ...  > CHUNK: xx  > ERROR: NET::ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING           Current Behavior  Currently I don t see any error. Request just ends without any marker of incomplete stream.       > CHUNK: xx  > ...  > END       While requesting URL from Chrome I ve got request status:        failed  NET::ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING       Request from CURL also gives an error:       >curl  i   raw http://localhost:1000/errdata  HTTP/1.1 200 OK  X Powered By: Express  Transfer Encoding: chunked  Date: Tue  30 May 2017 08:35:10 GMT  Connection: keep alive    1  [  10    i :1  item :1   1     10    i :2  item :2   1     10    i :3  item :3   1     curl:  18  transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining             Workaround  At the moment I found a workaround to raise an error on client side by violating HTTP chunked transfer encoding. It is handled properly but I dislike this approach as a dirty hack.       js  res.write  [  ;  res.write    i : 1   item : 1   ;  ...  // when error   violate chunked transfer by writing size less chunk directly to connection  res.connection.write  INVALID_END_OF_STREAM  ;  res.end  ;             Summary  Do you think it should be considered as a bug? Let me know if I missed something.  Thanks in advance.,vladminsky,open,2,2017-05-30 10:04:57,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

Knowing that the probability of that to happen is very small  my preoccupation is  is it a request issue or cached default behavior ? is there a way to fix that ?    below is used request code       js  request  https://weloobe.com/quizzcoin/api/get_question?level=easy    error  response  body  =>      if   error    response.statusCode == 200         ,romelo,closed,2,2017-06-06 15:37:23,2017-06-07 07:59:41,,,,0,1
7062,request/request,2680,Set multipart/form data request encoding,Hello     Thank you all for the awesome lib.    Here s the problem: currently  any multipart/form data POST request will reset content type to:   multipart/form data; boundary=  THE BOUNDARY    and will use utf 8 as the form charset  without specifying the charset in the content type field .    So  2 questions here:  1  How can i manage to post my form  multipart/form data  with files  with a charset encoding that is NOT set to UTF 8 ?  I don t own/control the server .  2  Why not giving a  charset  options  that would encode all strings from the form to the specified charset  based on iconv lite or something   then do the POST request with the appropriate charset header ?,snajjar,open,2,2017-06-06 17:11:30,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

Now just switch the  json: true  to  json: false  in order to   not   encode the   request   body    feature request    in JSON  and we get this:       js    node test.js        hello :  world        ./test.js:12            console.log  hello  in body                                 ^    TypeError: Cannot use  in  operator to search for  hello  in       hello :  world            at Request._callback  ./test.js:12:31       at Request.self.callback  ./node_modules/request/request.js:188:22       at emitTwo  events.js:106:13       at Request.emit  events.js:194:7       at Request.<anonymous>  ./node_modules/request/request.js:1171:10       at emitOne  events.js:96:13       at Request.emit  events.js:191:7       at IncomingMessage.<anonymous>  ./node_modules/request/request.js:1091:12       at Object.onceWrapper  events.js:293:19       at emitNone  events.js:91:20          And this is what I want to talk about.        Current Behavior    This  request  lib exposes the  json  parameter for requests  allowing the user to enable a set of things:    From https://github.com/request/request requestoptions callback :  >  body    entity body for PATCH  POST and PUT requests. Must be a  Buffer    >  String  or  ReadStream . If  json  is  true   then  body  must be a  > JSON serializable object.  >   > [...]  >   >  json    sets  body  to JSON representation of value and adds  Content type:  > application/json  header. Additionally  parses the response body as JSON.    The usecase that I m concerned with is the case where we need to do a request that is   not   a JSON request  but where the expected response   is   a JSON response  so where we want to be able to use the   Additionally  parses the response body as JSON    part despite this  json  param being set to  false .    Actually  as told in the documentation quoted some lines ago  the JSON parsing of the response is only enabled if the request itself is declared as  json :    From https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/request.js L1152 :     javascript  if  self._json       try        response.body = JSON.parse response.body  self._jsonReviver              Expected Behavior    I m feeling like it would make sense to be able to   enable this response parsing without depending on the  json  parameter  ; this is actually a need that I find myself with  and which is described in details below.        Possible Solution    I see 2 possibles solutions:    1. Add a  json_response  parameter that enables response parsing even if  json  is set to  false         Advantages: quite simple  just implies adding a new parameter and documenting it        Disadvantages: it would have to be clear what the default behavior is in case it s not defined  2. Add something a bit smarter  which parses the JSON in the Response body if the Response comes with  application/json  as  Content Type   which would totally make sense        Advantages: cleaner  imho        Disadvantages: might be a breaking change for people who are relying on response not being parsed right now        Context    I m using chakram  [site] http://dareid.github.io/chakram/   [github] https://github.com/dareid/chakram/   to test a REST API. This is just an extension for chai  [site] http://chaijs.com/   [github] https://github.com/chaijs/chai   that uses  request  for requests  and which is run by mocha  [site] http://mochajs.org/   [github] https://github.com/mochajs/mocha  .    Among my tests  I would like to test the edge case where I POST an   invalid   JSON to the API on purpose  but with a  Content Type  set correctly to  application/json ; the goal being to ensure that my API correctly detects the invalid JSON data and handles it propertly by sending back an   HTTP 400  error.    Concretely  this result in the following test: <https://gist.github.com/Horgix/6a612f2a86c7507663012f530ed66c59 file test_invalid_json js>    The   json : false  is here to disable the JSON serialization of my data by request lib  it is automatically enabled by chakram   and the manual definition of the  Content Type  header is here due to the fact that this is usually done by the  json  param  which I just explicitely set to  false .    My API returns an error looking like this:       json  HTTP/1.0 400 BAD REQUEST  Content Type: application/json          error :  400 Bad Request: Failed to decode JSON object: Unterminated string starting at: line 1 column 9  char 8              Until this point  everything is fine.    Except that  as explained in the  Current Behavior  part  I m setting the  json  param to  false   since I explicitely want to   avoid   my request s body from being serialized into JSON   so I don t benefit from the   Additionally  parses the response body as JSON.   part  despite the fact that I really want to use it since I m going to verify this response against a JSON schema  see test linked above . This is actually on this part that my test fails  since   the response body is no longer parsed   and is only a plain string  which obviously doesn t match whatever JSON schema that expects a dict  which would be got from parsing the reponse body .    That s at this point that I took a look at how this  json  think is handled and that I felt the need of this Feature Request.  Of course I could parse the response afterward by myself in a single line  but this is something I would expect  request  being able to do.        Your Environment    Not really relevant. Anyway I m using nodejs  v7.10.0  with request v 2.81.0 .,Horgix,open,7,2017-06-16 08:37:17,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

7046,request/request,2696,Violates streams flowing mode contract  losing  data  callbacks,Hi   This library is currently causing me some trouble due to an idiosyncrasy in streams handling. This is essentially the same as  2565 and  2567   the  response  stream begins in flowing mode  even though it is expected of Readable Streams in the Node.js world to start as  non flowing :  https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html stream_two_modes    I am passing the Response object to some other part of code via a Promise  and it effectively causes a part of the data to be lost  because  data  events are fired too soon  before the first listener is registered.    Additionally  since  response  emulates a ReadableStream  or so the README leads the user to believe   one would expect  response.pause    to stop the flow and mitigate the quirk. Alas  it does nothing   on the other hand  a  Request.prototype.pause  is implemented which does the same thing  but is outside the readable stream.    An effort should be taken to make the response object s stream API adhere to what the user normally expects of Readable Streams.    The root cause of this behaviour is probably this line: https://github.com/request/request/blob/b12a6245d9acdb1e13c6486d427801e123fdafae/request.js L1082    It looks like it proxies  data  events   only doing this immediately switches the underlying stream into flowing mode.    Another questionable operation in the code is https://github.com/request/request/blob/b12a6245d9acdb1e13c6486d427801e123fdafae/request.js L1114   even if we fix the flowing mode issue  it will be of no use if the response registers a  data  handler on itself. As an aside  registering event handlers on  this  is considered an anti pattern  and this is one case where it can be seen.,rkaw92,open,1,2017-06-26 11:14:14,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

If the content length is not fixed  keep the original one 240  the testlist field in server script will lost 26 characters.    So  I think we should fix it by recalculate the content length.  ,lifubang,open,1,2017-06-28 06:05:15,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

If i look with firefox dev tool  apparently there is only one redirection  to the same addresse i don t know why   the only difference is the chunked mode in the response headers  . is due to my code   or the request code  or some other config issue ?    here is a sample of my code :       javascript  var proxiedRequest = request.defaults  proxy:  http://proxy.xxx.xxxxxxx.be:XXXX   maxRedirects : 5        proxiedRequest.get that.buildRequest url.url    error  response  body  =>            let html = null;          let status = null;          let failed = false;            if   error    response.statusCode === 200     response.headers[ content type ].includes  text/html      response.headers[ content type ].includes  application/xhtml xml                   html = body;            else if  error    response.statusCode  = 200                 status = response.statusCode;              failed = true;           else if error                 failed = true;                       that.emit  getFinished     html : html  status : status  error : error  failed : failed  url : url    ;               the buildrequest methode :       javascript  this.buildRequest = function url            return                url: url.href               headers:                     User Agent :  Mozilla/5.0  Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:54.0  Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0                     Accept :  text/html application/xhtml xml application/xml;q=0.9  / ;q=0.8                     Connection  :  keep alive                     Accept Encoding : this.selectAcceptEncodingHeader url.protocol                               gzip: true               deflate: true                  .bind this ;   this.selectAcceptEncodingHeader = function protocol            if protocol ===  https:                 return  gzip  deflate  br ;                         return  gzip  deflate ;       .bind this ;       Thanks by advance for your help  ,deckbsd,closed,1,2017-07-24 14:33:51,2017-07-25 13:52:48,,,,0,1

Like i said i have a problem when i do a GET request on that url : https://extranet.ores.be/de/services/price simulation    why ? actually when you do a get request on that the first reponse is 302  but this one is chunked   but request doesn t take it in account. And also that response   send as location header  the same path  so reuqest seems to be stuck in an infinite loop.,deckbsd,closed,0,2017-07-25 07:57:27,2017-07-25 13:52:59,,,,0,1

7008,request/request,2734,OAuth signing with nested query strings,    Summary  OAuth failure with  Invalid Signature  in the case of query strings with nested objects  using the default library  qs .        Simplest Example to Reproduce  Attempt to make an OAuth request with a query string containing nested objects.       js  request.get     url:  /orders     json: true    oauth:      consumer_key:        consumer_secret:        token:        token_secret:            qs:       searchCriteria :        filterGroups : [        filters : [         field :  key          value :  val        ]                                Expected Behavior  The query string passed on to sign is being stringified correctly but then is re parsed by the default qs library which turns it back in to a nested object before being parsed back on to the signing function.        Current Behavior  The signing function expects key/values and will treat it like so resulting in an invalid signature.        Possible Solution  When re parsing the query string simply use the default  querystring  module instead of qs which will keep the object keys nested  i.e. searchCriteria[filterGroups][0][filters][0][field][key]  and will produce a valid signature.  ,jstans,open,0,2017-08-07 11:21:03,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

In the example  I m trying to send a POST request to  http://localhost:3000/    where     gets converted to     .        Simplest Example to Reproduce  The backend server:     js  let express = require  express  ;  let app = express  ;  app.post  /:id   function req  res        let id = req.params.id;      console.log id ;      res.send id ;    ;  app.listen 3000 ;       The request:     js  let request = require  request  ;  require  request debug   request ;  let url= http://localhost:3000/  ;  let options1 =        body:   test: 0         json: true   ;  let options2 =        body: JSON.stringify   test: 0      ;  let options3 =        body: JSON.stringify   test: 0          json: false   ;  let options4 =   ;  request.post url  options1  function error  response         console.log response.body ;    ;             Expected Behavior  All requests should be logged and returned as     by the server.        Current Behavior  Only  options4  and not using  options  at all returns      where  options1    options2  and  options3  return     .        Possible Solution  It seems that when the options are being handled the URL gets reencoded. For this specific transformation to happen  the URL seems to be recognized as  latin 1  before.        Context  I m using it to test all the routes in the backend of an app and accented characters can be used in user s ids  resulting in routes like  /user/m rio/phone . The app itself sends the request correctly  this problem only happens when using this request library.

6984,request/request,2758,agent: false without pool: false uses globalAgent?,    Summary    It looks common to get the  ESOCKETTIMEDOUT  error and some solutions say to use  agent: false .  This might lead one to believe that a new agent is being created  per request  as noted in the Node.js docs: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest v6.x/docs/api/http.html http_class_http_agent        Expected Behavior     agent: false  should create a new agent instance for each request?        Current Behavior    1. If the  pool  option is unset then the  globalPool  is used: https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/request.js L172  2. This means the  agent  is set to the return value of  self.getNewAgent   : https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/request.js L487  3. Which is the  globalAgent : https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/request.js L687        Possible Solution    Not saying this is a bug  but perhaps I didn t understand the options.  The docs say:    > pool   an object describing which agents to use for the request. If this option is omitted the request will use the global agent  as long as your options allow for it . Otherwise  request will search the pool for your custom agent. If no custom agent is found  a new agent will be created and added to the pool. Note: pool is used only when the agent option is not specified.    In this case  agent  is specified but I am not sure what  as long as your options allow for it  means.  Assuming the issue brought up here is accurate  solutions could be:    1. Be explicit in the documentation that  agent: false  does not mean  pool: false   2. If  agent: false  and  pool  is unset  then default  pool  to  false  and document it.        Context    Possibly related to  ESOCKETTIMEDOUT  errors.           If the above looks accurate and a PR is desired  please let me know and I can certainly create one.,jayflo,open,1,2017-09-06 12:35:09,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

Ideally the timer should have started after the request is triggered but in this case it seems like the timer starts immediately which is causing this issue.

However I have a few questions/need help with:    So at basic I see I can use some code like this:         var request = require  request  ;    let options =              url:  https://theURLToForm            form:                email:  me@example.com                email2:  me@example.com                fname:  firstname                lname:  surname               ;    request.post options  function err httpResponse body             console.log body     ;         My questions:    1   The URL to the form   the page itself contains 3 forms   the one I want to use has the attribute name=Regi1Form   so do I need to specify that in my options  if so how?    2   The fields I want to enter text into  in the options block above I m using keys like email and email2 because in the code the input has a name attribute with that value. Is the correct way to enter into the field?    3   The first page of the form contains the input fields themselves. However once I feel in the fields and click Submit   it goes to a second page where I have to click I Agree   then finally a 3rd page with a submit field. Can this be handled with request?    4   With Selenium I can actually see what it is doing   however with request how do i actually verify that its completing the form?    Thanks.,psmod2,closed,0,2017-09-28 01:03:53,2017-09-28 03:06:13,,,,0,1

6949,request/request,2794,Form data throws  ReferenceError: window is not defined  in Webpack bundle,    Summary      UPDATE: The problem is caused by [this form data issue/commit] https://github.com/form data/form data/issues/252 issuecomment 249051882 .       The form data entry point is throwing this exception.      ORIGINAL:      Request 2.83.0 is not compatible with Webpack 3.7.1 due to an issue with the form data dependency. I am able to bundle everything using Webpack  but upon running my bundle I encounter a  ReferenceError: window is not defined  exception.     It appears to be caused by importing this function:         /  459  /  /   /  function module  exports       /  eslint env browser  /  module.exports = typeof self ==  object  ? self.FormData : window.FormData;         I tracked this function to form data:         var FormData = __webpack_require__ 459          And then I tracked form data to request. Commenting out the  module.exports  line above causes the exception to no longer occur.        Expected Behavior    My Webpack bundle should run without any exceptions caused by modules.        Current Behavior    Form data throws an exception  breaking my Webpack bundle.        Possible Solution    [Require form data on demand  so it doesn t throw an exception when it is not in use.] https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/commit/f80e1473cb0e1c1ce5d24919c4b5abc469e4fb06         Context    Webpack is obviously one of the most popular build tools out there  and request/request promise should be compatible.     Here is the full stacktrace:                  The  request  library is not installed automatically anymore.

6936,request/request,2807,npm install fails intermittently due to race condition in Redirect.prototype.onResponse,    Summary  We spent the past 3 months investigating an issue where  npm install  would fail intermittently.    NPM 4 shows an error like this:         npm ERR  tar.unpack unzip error C: example project temp npm tmp npm 13780 b27f9707 onedrive.pkgs.visualstudio.com _packaging team npm registry cldrjs   cldrjs 0.4.8.tgz         When we inspected the NPM cache  we found that the downloaded tarball was truncated.  This mostly seems to happen in repos that have lots of multi megabyte dependencies  and in configurations where the NPM registry redirects the HTTP request for the tarball.  It was extremely difficult to investigate because it s a race condition that will stop happening if you change any number of things  the computer  the time of day  the proxy settings  etc .    The issue also occurs with the NPM 5 client  but the error message is different  although still ultimately due to a corrupted tarball :         npm ERR  code EINTEGRITY  npm ERR  sha1 20E D1MrUwyeZvYOmVLkQnQ o1Y= integrity checksum failed when using sha1: wanted sha1 20E D1MrUwyeZvYOmVLkQnQ o1Y= but got sha1 ygU0cyjTuZdxezDk6ofWXCGJbqI=.  867808 bytes          The issue also occurs with the [PNPM client] https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm   which relies on the   Request   library as well.      >    UPDATE:   PNPM is no longer affected by this issue.  See comments.     In this case  the symptom is an unhandled stream error:                       events.js:160                                 throw er; // Unhandled  error  event                                 ^                   Error: read ECONNRESET                               at exports._errnoException  util.js:1018:11                                at TLSWrap.onread  net.js:572:26          Wireshark and the VSTS server logs show that the server is correctly streaming the tarball.  In fact  we can repro the issue using [Fiddler] https://www.telerik.com/fiddler  on the local machine  and Fiddler downloads the full tarball  even though NPM still fails.  The explanation is that the NPM client is aborting the connection due to a bug in the   Request   library.        Simplest Example to Reproduce    We ultimately debugged this using a physical PC that consistently repros the problem.  Unfortunately we cannot find any other environment that consistently encounters the errors  even though 10 or more people have reported these issues to us over the past few months.  In some cases it fails consistently on the person s computer for a day or so  then suddenly starts working again.  It was really difficult to pin down.        Problem Analysis    The problem happens when the request for a tarball encounters an HTTP redirect to an Azure blob storage URL.  It goes like this:       Request.init    initializes a bunch of data structures     Request.start    creates a connection  obtains a socket  wires up event handlers    Stream events are fired such as  socket  and  request   and processed by the calling application    An HTTP response is received and passed to  Request.onRequestResponse       At this point  the [lib/redirect.js] https://github.com/request/request/blob/253c5e507ddb95dd88622087b6387655bd0ff935/lib/redirect.js L79  module kicks in with a kind of hacky way of handling this:      It tries to carefully delete all the state that was set up so far:     javascript    delete request.src    delete request.req    delete request._started    if  response.statusCode  == 401    response.statusCode  == 307         // Remove parameters from the previous response  unless this is the second request      // for a server that requires digest authentication.      delete request.body      delete request._form      if  request.headers           request.removeHeader  host          request.removeHeader  content type          request.removeHeader  content length          if  request.uri.hostname  == request.originalHost.split  :  [0]             // Remove authorization if changing hostnames  but not if just          // changing ports or protocols .  This matches the behavior of curl:          // https://github.com/bagder/curl/blob/6beb0eee/lib/http.c L710          request.removeHeader  authorization                                ...but note that it doesn t unwire any event handlers  and it obviously cannot undo any stream events that were already processed by the caller    Then it calls  Request.init    again on the same object    Which causes  Request.start    to create a new connection and a new a socket  and wire up the same event handlers to these new objects    Stream events are fired such as  socket  and  request  are fired a second time    The second HTTP response is received and passed to  Request.onRequestResponse     which starts streaming bytes to the calling application    Even though this design seems super brittle  it does work most of the time.  In most cases  the tarball is successfully streamed and unzipped.    But every once in a while  [onRequestError  ] https://github.com/request/request/blob/253c5e507ddb95dd88622087b6387655bd0ff935/request.js L862  will get called with an ECONNRESET error that crashes the install.  Here s the details:      The error occurs after the above sequence  and always on the second socket for that   Request   instance    Inside  onRequestError     we find that  self.req.socket.destroyed  is true.  It seems to be an old socket that was supposed to be returned to the connection pool.    The Wireshark timings show that this ECONNRESET error is for an unused HTTP connection that has been idle for a while  and is now timing out due to keepalive    But we never find a socket in that state [where it s first obtained] https://github.com/request/request/blob/253c5e507ddb95dd88622087b6387655bd0ff935/request.js L778     seems like something is destroying the socket later    For the PNPM repro  the application s error handler is missing because it s a  once  handler that has already fired once before.  We tried working around this by attaching a second handler  but it just crashes later because [npm registry client] https://github.com/npm/npm registry client/blob/c03a77aba3e86e191b4025e34da47afb452c684a/lib/fetch.js L40  tries to push the error back down onto the response s stream  creating an infinite loop        Possible Solution  <     Not obligatory  but suggest a fix/reason for the bug    >  <     or ideas how to implement the addition or change   >    I believe the ideal solution would be to rethink the design of   lib/redirect.js    to avoid trying to reconstruct the Request instance  and to avoid mixing together stream events from two different HTTP requests.  That s probably a lot of work.    For PNPM  which we are using now   we found a workaround which simply ignores the error and prevents it from tripping up the installation:       javascript  Request.prototype.onRequestError = function  error       var self = this    if  self._aborted         return         if  self.req    self.req._reusedSocket    error.code ===  ECONNRESET          self.agent.addRequestNoreuse         self.agent =   addRequest: self.agent.addRequestNoreuse.bind self.agent         self.start        self.req.end        return         if  self.timeout    self.timeoutTimer         clearTimeout self.timeoutTimer       self.timeoutTimer = null           // PROPOSED WORKAROUND:    if  self.req    self.req.socket    self.req.socket.destroyed         return;           self.emit  error   error             It s interesting that a few lines above  someone else had written some logic that seems to be handling a similar issue for the [ForeverAgent] https://github.com/request/forever agent  case.  However that code was disabled [forever ago] https://github.com/request/request/blob/253c5e507ddb95dd88622087b6387655bd0ff935/request.js L471 .    This workaround unfortunately does not fix NPM  even though the  self.req.socket.destroyed  condition does get executed many times during the install.          Context  <     How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish?   >  <     Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world   >  I m not sure why the race condition suddenly became so frequent this summer.  We ve tried upgrading/downgrading NodeJS and NPM and   request   and   npm registry client   and it has no effect.  8 different experts from various teams  including Azure and Visual Studio Team Services  all worked together on this investigation.    It s been a huge headache for us. I just received another problem report from someone   as I was typing up this issue  .  : P  It would be awesome if it could get some attention.  You can find [lots] https://github.com/facebookincubator/create react app/issues/1427  and [lots] https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs/issues/172  of [examples] https://github.com/mithunsatheesh/node rules/issues/32  of people struggling with these symptoms.

6933,request/request,2810,Nodejs Hangs up on Receiving 202 statusCode and retries automatically after 2 mins,    Context  I am creating a nodejs client server for my angular app. Request is sent to process large data  while data is being processed we send back 202 status Code. I use same handler Callback for all requests which basically Emails me request log details on call back and options are as follows . It is working for many requests which doesn t send back 202 but only 200. But at this particular request the nodejs server itself stops responding to further requests. From main server logs we know that the request from nodejs server is going through but response is not handled at nodejs. And whole nodejs is stuck up and no further requests to the nodejs server are entertained. I have to restart server for everything to work again. And there are no error in logs available. For some reason nodejs server sends a request 2 min after first request which got 202  and that gets resolved to 200 as processing is over by then.

6930,request/request,2813,Request options.json and options.form inconsistencies,   The Problem  There s two ways to send JSON  as stated in the docs  readme :    1. .json = object  2. .json = true AND .body = object    In the json function  when using the  pair method   .json = true AND body = object   there is a check to see if there isn t already a form urlencoded content type header already set before trying to send JSON  if there is  it actually treats the request as a .form request  and encodes body right in the JSON function  without the various checks the .form function provides to ensure the body is encoded correctly  for example  in cases where it s an object .    However  with the .json = object method  it doesn t care about existing headers that may or may not be there  and goes ahead and stringify s the object to send JSON regardless. One flaw with this  is that if there IS a form urlencoded content type header present  this is maintained despite that it s sending a stringify ied object.    There s actually a heap of issues that come up because of this that are really hard to articulate without writing a book  because what we have now is that neither .json or .form behave in a consistent fashion. I can see why the JSON stuff was done this way  but when you re a user using this library  chasing some of these seemingly random variances in output is really tricky and time consuming.    The actual root problem here that I originally wanted to fix  which I think causes all this weirdness  is that .json is used both as a flag to  Accept: application/json   and as a mechanism to actually send a JSON payload where it ultimately becomes  Content Type: application/json . However the two aren t mutually inclusive and this is where the issues come in. This seems like a design issue. These potentially should be separated into two different flags  or perhaps the convenience functionality should be removed  or people should be unable to add what fits the requirements for both a form and json request simultaneously.    This problem is compounded by the various combinations you can have of options.form  options.json  options.body  and options.headers.        Potential Solution and Step in the Right Direction    Trying to fix what I deem as the root issue above  seemed to be a tangled mess that wasn t going to be very backwards compatible  so in the pull request to follow  I instead opted to achieve:    1. If .form and .json functions worry about content type headers  they should worry about them in all use cases.    2. Because request worries about the content type headers  looking at the options flags .form and .json isn t enough to determine if the request should be a form or JSON request. Since headers can be manually injected into the options parameter.    3. Unify the form processing logic  don t have the .json function do what work that the .form function should have already performed  since it runs first.    4. Ultimate goal is to have  .json = object  ==  .json = true AND body = object  be equivalent  and on the flipside form requests with a body be equivalent.    5. By making the functionality consistent and more readable  hopefully   the consistency will help users will not fall into the trap of trying various combinations and seeing differing results while debugging  and contributors maintaining request will easily grasp the intentions of the software.

For example  [request.js:1389] https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/request.js L1389  converts the method to all uppercase  while [index.js:L49] https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/index.js L49  is only checking against all upper case. In this specific case  if    head    is the method  it could still by pass all the checks. Thus IMO  the easiest way to solve this is to document the casing. Personally  I d prefer to make HTTP method case insensitive as a feature  however  due to lack of knowledge about the code base  I m not able to create an PR for that.    <    Reviewable:start   >       This change is [<img src= https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg  height= 34  align= absmiddle  alt= Reviewable />] https://reviewable.io/reviews/request/request/2827   <    Reviewable:end   >  ,sharils,open,1,2017-12-07 14:58:07,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,1,1

6912,request/request,2831,Remove hawk dependency,I can t take this any more.    Request has a dependency on [hawk] https://www.npmjs.com/package/hawk  even though no one uses that feature. It was added because @mikeal was using it a few years ago. People who use hawk are more likely to be using other hapi ecosystem modules like wreck and no hawk user needs it integrated like this. I wrote hawk and am its main user and I don t want it integrated in wreck  the module I use instead of request.    Every other week some request user opens an issue on hawk  hoek  boom  or the other dependencies with shitty attitude and a sense of entitlement  even if they think they are being nice about it  demanding changes  asking to support older versions of node  removing dependencies that annoy their build system  complain about how it s not working well with yarn  and other issues I don t care about.    NONE of these people USE hawk  or give a crap about the way I do things. I am not asking them to. These are developers that have not chosen to work within my ecosystem and my way of doing things. This was forced on them as much as on me.    It is also absurd that every month  hawk is downloaded 24 million times  hoek 26 millions times  boom 36 million times  cryptiles 24 million times  and sntp 24 million times FOR NO REASON  That s over 100 millions monthly download of code NO ONE uses.    I am always happy to try and solve real issues people have with my code. I take pride of my work and go out of my way to support people who honored me with building their product using it. But this is not part of the deal. You don t get to waste my time if you don t use my work in a meaningful way.    Please find the less disruptive way to remove this or make it optional in some way. For example  joi has a dependency on isemail that is structured in a way that the module is only loaded when needed which allows people to not require they don t want it.    At some point  I am going to take one sided actions that will force this move. I am not going to break anything but I sure can annoy the fuck out of everyone with colorful console logs...    We are like a couple who finds out a year later that when got drunk one night and got married.

6911,request/request,2832,Some exceptions ignore  error  event listener,    Summary  Current  request  version fires some exceptions synchronously  not letting users to handle them with an   error   event listener.  Those exceptions could still be handled with a  callback .  But since using  callback  causes  request  to buffer incoming data  it may not be an option.        Simplest Example to Reproduce       js  request  invalid_uri      .on  error      => console.log  error       .on  complete      => console.log  complete                Expected Behavior    Since   error   handler was attached to request object synchronously  it s expected to catch all exceptions  including  Invalid URI  exception.        Current Behavior    Right now   error   event with  Invalid URI  exception is fired synchronously inside a  request ...   call before any   error   handler could be attached.  As a result  this exception is thrown into an event loop.        Possible Solution  One possible solution is to wrap all synchronous  .emit  error   ...   calls with [process.nextTick] https://nodejs.org/api/process.html process_process_nexttick_callback_args .  It should deffer   error   events firing enough to let users register their error handlers.        Context  I ve encountered this issue while downloading huge files from a remote server using  request .  Since those files are very large  their content is piped into an appropriate consumer immediately.  In other circumstances I could ve used  callback  to handle all exceptions. But registering a  callback  causes  request  to buffer an entire response  which is absolutely unacceptable in my case.

6904,request/request,2839,AWS options should support region and service name for non standard SigV4 endpoints,    Summary  aws option in requests not sufficient for non standard AWS URLs.        Simplest Example to Reproduce  <     If describing a bug  tell us what request options we can use to reproduce the same bug/behavior   >       js  request      method:  POST      url:  https://a39m6bjbcdlsl4.iot.us east 1.amazonaws.com       aws:        key:  foo        secret:  bar                       Expected Behavior  The user needs a way to provide a region and service name so that aws4 will calculate the correct signature in the case that the user is using a non standard SigV4 signed endpoint.        Current Behavior  Currently a user attempting to make a call to a non standard endpoint will receive an error that an incorrect signature has been calculated.        Possible Solution  The simplest thing to do here seems to be to modify request.js and add region and service as new fields in the options object that gets passed to aws4 for signing.        Context  This problem has forced me to locally modify request in order to workaround this issue and be able to correctly sign requests to my IoT endpoint.,nickrobinson,open,0,2018-01-08 12:46:19,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

6892,request/request,2851,Unwanted behavior of request on some linux distros.,    Summary  So far this issue is reproducible on Ubuntu and Fedora 27.    The problem is that when you send another instance of    request    inside the callback of a previous    request     the second request is somewhat swallowed or hiding somewhere and will just come up if there is another instance of request is send.  And this also will prevent the use of promise chaining.    I already post it on SO [Unable to send request from request callback] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48135641/unable to send request from request callbackl .        Simple Example to Reproduce  I did a sample project https://github.com/zer09/request_test  It include the express server and a electron app.  There is the 3 menus to test  Get Request    Post Request    Post Promise Request .  The result can be seen on console.        Expected Behavior  You should see the result of the second request.        Current Behavior  The second request is somewhat swallowed.        Possible Solution  Hmmm  sorry  I don t have any idea for now  I don t have depth understanding how request works at the moment  basically I just starting studying JS since last year.        Context  Actually this works on MS Windows  tested on vm  but using on Fedora the problem exists. If you create app using electron  then possibly this wont work on some distro of linux.

We noticed this error in our logs:        Error: options.uri must be a path when using options.baseUrl    When a client requests the path:        /item/detail/395691820/? deeplink_path=item/detail/395691820/  fallback_url=https://offerup.com/item/detail/395691820/ button=item_view user_id=36953831 event_id=2018 01 26_LosAngeles_CA_5 _branch_match_id=459093596557993047    After some tinkering it seems to be the URL that s the problem. Here s the stack trace:         Error: options.uri must be a path when using options.baseUrl      at Request.init  /Users/john.simons/repos/webapp/monorepo/services/web/src/node_modules/request/request.js:212:33       at new Request  /Users/john.simons/repos/webapp/monorepo/services/web/src/node_modules/request/request.js:130:8       at request  /Users/john.simons/repos/webapp/monorepo/services/web/src/node_modules/request/index.js:54:10       at /Users/john.simons/repos/webapp/monorepo/services/web/src/request_test.js:18:25      at Layer.handle [as handle_request]  /Users/john.simons/repos/webapp/monorepo/services/web/src/node_modules/express/lib/router/layer.js:95:5       at trim_prefix  /Users/john.simons/repos/webapp/monorepo/services/web/src/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:317:13       at /Users/john.simons/repos/webapp/monorepo/services/web/src/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:284:7      at Function.process_params  /Users/john.simons/repos/webapp/monorepo/services/web/src/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:335:12       at next  /Users/john.simons/repos/webapp/monorepo/services/web/src/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:275:10       at expressInit  /Users/john.simons/repos/webapp/monorepo/services/web/src/node_modules/express/lib/middleware/init.js:40:5          Also I boiled it down to as simple of a repro case as I could  but it still depends on Express:    That code is below.

6884,request/request,2859,Feature Request: Option to disable automatic URLEncode of URL,    Summary  Add an option to the  RequestPromiseOptions  for disabling automatic URLEncoding of characters in Urls        Context  I know this is an odd feature request.  I am working with Azure Media Services API. I need to make a request to a URL like        https://media.windows.net/API/Locators  nb:lid:UUID:5bfcb65d 843d 4d5e bf71 9306ecb08203          See their API documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en us/rest/api/media/operations/locator and yes  I didn t believe it worked this way either.     Sending the request with request  the single quotes get replaced by   27 s and the request fails with  401   undefined  in the message.  Inspecting the error object reporting the error shows something like this under  request/uri/href .        ...    href : https://blob.restv2.location.media.azure.net/api/Locators  27nb:lid:UUID:f4db7680 45b4 404c 91e9 abcdefabcdef 27     ...         I can make valid requests using Postman and request libraries in other languages where I can force the  correct  behavior  unescaped single quotes .  Also  endpoints other than ones that expect the singlequotes work properly  so I know I have the correct host and authorization information.    There are options for the query string  but those options do not apply to the rest of the URL.    I have searched deeply for documentation  and searched existing issues extensively  but nothing covers this use case.  If there is already support or a workaround for this  please let me know how.        Your Environment    software           version                                  request            2.83.0    node               8.8.1    npm                5.5.1    Operating System   Win10 x64    Thank you for your time and consideration.  ,ninjapretzel,closed,1,2018-01-30 19:14:19,2018-02-02 23:15:48,,,,0,1
6883,request/request,2860,Support proxy basic auth in URL without password,  [x] I have run  npm test  locally and all tests are passing.    [x] I have added/updated tests for any new behavior.    According to [RFC 2617] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617 section 2   Basic authentication must have a  :  between the username and password  and according to [RFC 3986] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 section 3.2.1   the  userinfo  component doesn t require the  :  character to be present.    The usual interpretation of that is that if an URI defines authentication with just an username  e.g.  http://user@host   when this is translated to Basic authentication  the password is considered empty and  user:  is sent  sending just  user  would be invalid .    This is currently supported for the main request URI  but it s not tested for  maybe it s a side effect of the way the code is written   but not supported for proxy with authentication in the URL.    This PR:    1. Adds test for the main request URI to make sure it supports the username being defined in the URI without a  :  and a password  and that it translates to a valid Basic authentication.  2. Adds test for both proxy and proxy connect to ensure this behaviour.  3. Fix the proxy authentication code to ensure the  :  is present in the Basic authorization header.  4. Fix the proxy connect code to support this case. I m unsure if this should be fixed here in directly in tunnel agent but I m assuming the latter is more low level and maybe shouldn t care about that.      Note:   tests pass locally  not sure why it does not on CI but seems unrelated.,valeriangalliat,open,0,2018-01-31 21:48:51,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,1,1

6871,request/request,2872,TLS Check Server Identity callback silently dropped,    Summary    NodeJS provides a [checkServerIdentity] https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html tls_tls_checkserveridentity_host_cert  callback function which is generally used by userland to add extra validation for the server certificate  such as pinning the certificate fingerprint.    This works very well in all cases  except for the tunneling agent.  When the TLS options are being copied over from the standard  options  argument  there is a [whitelist of options] https://github.com/request/request/blob/v2.83.1/lib/tunnel.js L70 L87   which unfortunately does not include the  checkServerIdentity  callback.    This results in a security accident where certificate pinning works in environment without proxy  while the check is silently skipped when being proxied.          Simplest Example to Reproduce       js  var request = require  request  ;    var options =        url:  https://www.google.com/        checkServerIdentity:  servername  peer  =>            const good =  77:53:28:AD:42:B1:04:F7:49:2B:C7:C7:7B:2A:84:64:EA:0B:1F:CE ;          const bad =  mismatch           if  peer.fingerprint  == bad                 return new Error   Fingerprint mismatch  ;                     console.log  Woohoo  www.google.com is using our pinned fingerprint            ;    request options  function  error  response  body       console.log  error:   error ;    ;         Currently  when the script is execute with     shell    node poc.js       it correctly rejects the certificate and returns the  Fingerprint mismatch  error.  However  when running behind proxy:     shell    https_proxy=http://localhost:3128 node poc.js       The script will erroneously continue  never calling the checkServerIdentity function at all.        Expected Behavior         error: Error: Fingerprint mismatch      at Object.checkServerIdentity  /var/www/git repos/tunnel/poc.js:9:20       at TLSSocket.onConnectSecure  _tls_wrap.js:1051:27       at TLSSocket.emit  events.js:160:13       at TLSSocket._finishInit  _tls_wrap.js:638:8              Current Behavior         error: null             Possible Solution      Easiest fix is to add  checkServerIdentity  to the whitelist    IMHO the best fix would be removing the whitelist and simply forward all the options over again    ,Hannes-Magnusson-CK,open,0,2018-02-14 17:16:40,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,NeedsCode,,,0,1

This is a deliberate choice in the code  to do the same as curl  for security reasons     Curl does have an option   location trusted for overriding that behaviour though:  https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html   location trusted  so this pull request is to add an equivalent option  redirectLocationTrusted  to request. If not supplied this option defaults to false  keeping the original behaviour.    In this change I ve kept  redirectLocationTrusted  as the simple boolean that curl has. It _could_ be overloaded for finer grained options  e.g. a domain matching regex  if it was felt that would be of more value.,gareth-robinson,open,2,2018-02-19 09:57:14,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,1,1
6866,request/request,2877,Tests consistently failing in Travis CI,    Summary  Since the end of 2017 all Pull requests are all failing at the test headers test; this appears to be because of two issues  1. The  catch invalid characters error  test works on node v4   v6  but fails on v8.  2. The  IPv6 Host Header  test fails in all builds        Simplest Example to Reproduce  These are test bugs rather than functional bugs   compare the CI builds for the recent pull requests and see they all fail in the same way.        Current Behavior       1. Headers characters tests fails on node v8  The  catch invalid characters error  test works on node v4   v6  but fails on v8.  This test appears to be asserting _node_ functionality; there isn t anything in the request code that actually throws the error message the test looks for. The error message that node throws has changed between versions:    v6   https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v6.x/lib/_http_outgoing.js L359  v8   https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/_http_outgoing.js L496    So what s the best solution here?    1. Remove the test  since it is checking node functionality rather than the library functionality?  Or if the test needs to exist to check that  request  properly rethrows the error  2. Change request to catch the error and throw it s own consistent error?  3. Change the test to check accept either error message?    I d prefer 3. here I think.         2. The  IPv6 Host Header  test fails in all builds  There are a number of pages on this e.g.  https://github.com/travis ci/travis ci/issues/4964 issuecomment 159748141  https://github.com/travis ci/travis ci/issues/9207  https://github.com/njh/travis ipv6 test    Basically it appears that IPv6 is not supported on travis ci  and only worked previously as  a by product of where we ve been hosting   first link above . The second link above suggests it stopped working around the end of October  which would match when the pull requests started failing.    So what s the best solution here? I ve only got one solution  so others are welcome...    1. Since the environments don t support IPv6  then don t run the IPv6 test. Pass some environment flag that allows that particular test to be skipped.

6864,request/request,2879,Allow for custom headers in aws signature,    Summary  On line 1367 of request.js when signing for the aws 4 signature  request only uses the  content type  header and doesn t allow for other headers to be passed in. This unfortunately produces an invalid signature when making a request to aws.    Code issue occurs here         if  opts.sign_version === 4    opts.sign_version ===  4          // use aws4      var options =          host: self.uri.host         path: self.uri.path         method: self.method           headers:             content type : self.getHeader  content type                            body: self.body             var signRes = aws4.sign options           accessKeyId: opts.key         secretAccessKey: opts.secret         sessionToken: opts.session                     Simplest Example to Reproduce  To reproduce this call a more specific aws instance  for example aws cloudwatch  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLogStreams.html    A sample request from aws docs looks like this:       POST / HTTP/1.1  Host: logs.<region>.<domain>  X Amz Date: <DATE>  Authorization: AWS4 HMAC SHA256 Credential=<Credential>  SignedHeaders=content type;date;host;user agent;x amz date;x amz target;x amzn requestid  Signature=<Signature>  User Agent: <UserAgentString>  Accept: application/json  Content Type: application/x amz json 1.1  Content Length: <PayloadSizeBytes>  Connection: Keep Alive  X Amz Target: Logs_20140328.DescribeLogStreams        logGroupName :  my log group           Sample request using request would look like this:             method :  POST       timeout : 10000      url :  https://logs.us east 1.amazonaws.com       body :    logGroupName : my log group         aws :         key : <access key>        secret : <secret key>        sign_version : 4           headers :         Accept :  application/json         Content Type :  application/x amz json 1.1         Connection :  Keep Alive         X Amz Target :  Logs_20140328.PutLogEvents                    With this sample request we would need to include  X Amz Target  in the signature and  Accept  as the others are already auto generated through aws4 signing.        Expected Behavior  Custom headers set through the request api  should be part of the signature. At the moment the example request would generate a Sign header that looks like this:       SignedHeaders=content length;content type;content type;host;x amz date       When it should look like this:       SignedHeaders=accept;connection;content length;content type;host;x amz date;x amz target       Notice that the accept  connection  x amz target headers are still there. With incorrect Sign headers it is indicative of an incorrect signature for aws.        Current Behavior  Incorrect signatures lead to an error message that looks like this:       <InvalidSignatureException> n  <Message>The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your AWS Secret Access Key and signing method. Consult the service documentation for details. n nThe Canonical String for this request should have been n POST n/ n ncontent length:193 ncontent type: nhost:logs.us east 1.amazonaws.com nx amz date:20180222T181935Z n ncontent length;content type;host;x amz date na47e08f5b41b9ac4a0d4c93a909fb90f956c6f047513dfcc8caa3dde945ed206  n nThe String to Sign should have been n AWS4 HMAC SHA256 n20180222T181935Z n20180222/us east 1/logs/aws4_request nb4c68f9a051329634cf5086aa1ed6fc3c710a27d8aaf3cfe0b18e1288ac53ce2  n</Message> n</InvalidSignatureException> n             Possible Solution  This could be fixed by passing in options into the aws function  and calling options.headers       headers:         content type : options.headers           Not sure if there are any side effects with this but this should allow developers to get the correct signature when settings custom headers.        Context  Prevents me from making any specific action call to my aws services.    Currently a work around   I think that will work although not tested as of writing this  will be simply call request and the aws4 library. And creating the authorization header my self manually for this.         Edit   Tested the work around and it works smoothly  simply call        var aws = require  aws4  ;  aws.sign requestOptions  credentials ;        note requestOptions and credentials are parameters from here  https://github.com/mhart/aws4 api      Your Environment      software           version                                  request            2.72.0    node               8.2.1    npm                5.3    Operating System   Linux  ,lantern77,open,0,2018-02-22 19:59:53,0000-00-00 00:00:00,,,,0,1

But when I upgraded the package to 2.83  it never respects the timeout period mentioned. Then I upgraded the package to the latest version  2.85.0 and in this sometimes it s getting timed out stipulated time  desired behaviour  but sometimes it s not.    Can anybody help me?

6847,request/request,2896,Chunked FormData should not appear content length header.,    Summary  Should  NOT  send content length header while sending chunked formData.        Simplest Example to Reproduce       nc  l localhost 3000            js  request.postAsync      url:  http://localhost:3000      formData:        box       steps       cache       env: JSON.stringify env        workspace: tar.c          gzip: true          [workspace]          ;    OR    request.postAsync      url:  http://localhost:3000      headers:          transfer encoding :  chunked           formData:        box       steps       cache       env: JSON.stringify env        workspace: tar.c          gzip: true          [workspace]          ;             Expected Behavior  Send request with  transfer encoding: chunked .        Current Behavior  While upload with readstream  it should use  transfer encoding: chunked  but doesn t  and still call setContentLength function cause socket hang up.    If set header   transfer encoding: chunked  manually  the content length didn t disappear.  And still socket hang up.        Possible Solution  Detect if transfer encoding header equal to chunk    OR    Detect if formData contain with stream.    Use chunked without content length.
