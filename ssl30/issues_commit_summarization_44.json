Method now returns an optional result: The method now allows for the possibility of no result being returned.\n2. Method logic has been simplified: The implementation of the method has been made more concise and easier to understand.\n3. Method inputs have been refactored: The way the method accepts inputs has been changed to make it more flexible or easier to use.\n4. Method now checks for errors: The method now includes error checking to ensure that inputs are valid and prevent unexpected behaviors.\n5. Method has been refactored for better performance: The code has been reorganized to improve the efficiency of the method.\n6.

Here's an example of how I might summarize a common type of change:\n\nbefore changes: The method calculated the total cost of an order by adding up the prices of individual items.\nafter changes: The method now calculates the total cost of an order by multiplying the number of items by the price per item.</s>"}]}
