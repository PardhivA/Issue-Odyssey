First it wont install extensions 100% of the time and therefor wont restore novels for it.\r\n\r\nI restored a few more times and it got everything eventually", "issue_html_link": "https://github.com/shosetsuorg/shosetsu/pull/241", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shosetsuorg/shosetsu/issues/241", "CommitDetails": [{"index": 0, "url": "", "method_summarization": " The change in the method allows for loading the extensions from a separate repository before restoring them, instead of using the existing backup list.</s> The change in the method involves refactoring the `extensionsRepo.getExtension(2, extensionID)` to use a List comprehension `extensions.find { it.id == extensionID }` instead, and also changing the type of the `extensionsRepo` variable from `Repository<ExtensionEntity>?` to `List<GenericExtensionEntity>`. In summary, the method now uses a List to retrieve an ExtensionEntity instead of using a Repository with a getExtension method.</s> I cannot summarize the alteration without seeing the actual method code before and after the changes. Please provide the code snippets for an accurate one-line summarization.</s> The alteration summed up in one line: The list of extensions was renamed from \"extensionsRepo.getExtension(2, extensionID)\" to a simpler variable name \"extensions\" for easier reference in the code.</s>"}, {"index": 0, "url": "", "method_summarization": " I'm unable to see the specific lines of code you're referring to for providing an accurate one-line summarization of the alteration. Please provide the context or meaning of the changes for me to help you with that.</s> The alteration adds a log message before installing the extension and changes the installation message in the notification. Moreover, it adds a log message before restoring extension novels.</s>Before changes: Method contained a loop that attempted to restore each novel entity from backup and handled exceptions.\n\nAfter changes: Method logging message added before loop, restoring novels as before.</s>"}]}
