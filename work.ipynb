Each commit addresses different aspects of the Fullscreen Settings, such as fixing padding, enabling parameters, matching fullscreen to focus option, adding fullscreen option, fixing animation stutter, and cleaning up UI. The commits directly address the implementation of the Fullscreen Settings, making the connection between the issue and the commits very strong. The only reason it's not a perfect 100 is because some commits may be for general cleanup or improvements that are not directly linked to the Fullscreen Settings, but the majority of the commits are directly related.\n",

Some of the commits may indirectly contribute to enhancing the reader experience or interface, but the relationship to the fullscreen settings is not evident. Further explicit commits related to adding fullscreen settings could have helped in rating this better.\n"
