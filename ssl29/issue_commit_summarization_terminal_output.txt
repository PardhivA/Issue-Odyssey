The release (date) of a chapter gets cut off if it is to long. Though weirdly cut off, seemingly after a white space.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select a novel on BoxNovel with the default listing.
2. See the release (dates) of chapters.

**Expected behavior**
The complete release date gets displayed.

**Screenshots**

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

                        commit_summarization: In the altered method, instead of using `indexOfFirst` to get the index of the first unread or unread chapter, the method uses `firstOrNull` to retrieve the first occurrence of an unread/unread chapter, and assigns the index of that chapter to the output variable.

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

The issue talks about a cut off release date in the novel listing, while the commit summarization mentions a change to the alpha value of a release tag. The connection between these two pieces of information is not strong, and they address different aspects of the software - the issue deals with the rendering of novel release dates, while the commit summarization mentions a change to the display of release tags. Therefore, only a low percentage of similarity can be assigned to these two pieces of data.</s>

The snackbar resizes itself depending on whether there is a chapter selected, which is downloaded or not. This is frustrating when using the _select all_ options for chapters and then immediately selecting delete. After the _select all_ option a lag spike happens, which then changes the snackbar but the input on the screen does not hit the delete button but the download button.

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

**Screenshots**
I'm getting tired from typing extra details... it should be fine.... maybe?

**Device information:**
 - OS: Android 10 
 - App Version: 2.0.0-2344

**Additional context**
Additional context: As my grandpappy always said, "What a load of bullshit!"

 issue_title: [F-R] Snackbar Resizing Depending on Downloaded Chapters 
 issue_body: **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The snackbar resizes itself depending on whether there is a chapter selected, which is downloaded or not. This is frustrating when using the _select all_ options for chapters and then immediately selecting delete. After the _select all_ option a lag spike happens, which then changes the snackbar but the input on the screen does not hit the delete button but the download button.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The snackbar always shows the download and delete option. Optionally it grays them out until they are usable.
 
summarization:  The method now uses a constant variable name for the setting key instead of using the enumeration.</s>  [/INST] OUTPUT: 0%.

The issue and commit are about different topics. The issue is related to the resizing behavior of a snackbar, while the commit changes a method by using a constant variable instead of an enumeration.</s>

This way, I can give you a meaningful one-line summary of the alteration based on the before and after method changes.

Here are some general examples of one-line summaries based on common changes you might encounter:

* Renamed variable: Changed variable name for clarity
* Added parameter: Accepts new input to extend method functionality
* Removed parameter: Simplified method by removing unnecessary input
* Changed return type: Returned a different data type to reflect new logic
* Added error handling: Improved method reliability by adding error handling
* Refactored code: Made method more efficient or easier to understand
* Fixed bug: Resolved a known issue in the code
* Added new feature: Enhanced method functionality with a new feature

Keep in mind that these summaries depend on the specifics of the given codebase and the intent of the changes being made. Therefore, the above summaries should serve as guidelines rather than definitive answers. If you provide the before and after lines of code, I will be happy to help with a more accurate summary.</s>

 issue_title: [F-R] Snackbar Resizing Depending on Downloaded Chapters 
 issue_body: **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The snackbar resizes itself depending on whether there is a chapter selected, which is downloaded or not. This is frustrating when using the _select all_ options for chapters and then immediately selecting delete. After the _select all_ option a lag spike happens, which then changes the snackbar but the input on the screen does not hit the delete button but the download button.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8299260/140777141-8248908b-4f34-4c4d-ae0d-32fc9fc3e713.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8299260/140777147-36b9922c-92e2-45f9-b674-1af465a9ff32.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The snackbar always shows the download and delete option. Optionally it grays them out until they are usable.

                    INPUT:
						issue_title: "[Bug] [2186]'Teleportation' to chapter when you click the resume button is wrong if the sort is the oppisite"
                        issue_body: "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75091899/170125379-289b87c2-a4be-4a93-bab1-67885cf3815c.mp4

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

                        commit_summarization: In the altered method, instead of using `indexOfFirst` to get the index of the first unread or unread chapter, the method uses `firstOrNull` to retrieve the first occurrence of an unread/unread chapter, and assigns the index of that chapter to the output variable.

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

 issue_title: [F-R] Snackbar Resizing Depending on Downloaded Chapters 
 issue_body: **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The snackbar resizes itself depending on whether there is a chapter selected, which is downloaded or not. This is frustrating when using the _select all_ options for chapters and then immediately selecting delete. After the _select all_ option a lag spike happens, which then changes the snackbar but the input on the screen does not hit the delete button but the download button.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The snackbar always shows the download and delete option. Optionally it grays them out until they are usable.

For example, "Method now validates user input before processing it" or "Method now returns an error message instead of raising an exception".</s>  I cannot summarize the alteration without seeing the actual code in the given before and after method changes. However, I can provide an example of how the summary might look like based on two hypothetical methods:

 issue_body: **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The snackbar resizes itself depending on whether there is a chapter selected, which is downloaded or not. This is frustrating when using the _select all_ options for chapters and then immediately selecting delete. After the _select all_ option a lag spike happens, which then changes the snackbar but the input on the screen does not hit the delete button but the download button.

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount

4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

 [/INST] The changes seem to be about separating the key identification part from the value assignment part. Before the change, the method was evaluating the key type based on the whole key string, while after the change, it's evaluating the key type based on the part after the "_" symbol. Both the before and after methods perform the same assignments to the maps based on the evaluated key type.</s>

 [/INST] The changes seem to include separating the key name and its data type with an underscore (_) character in the setting key string, and handling the data type extraction in a more concise way using the `substringBefore` and `substringAfter` methods. Therefore, the alteration can be summarized as:

_Modified the setting key string format to include the data type, making it easier to extract the data type from the key string._</s>

 issue_title: [F-R] Snackbar Resizing Depending on Downloaded Chapters 
 issue_body: **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The snackbar resizes itself depending on whether there is a chapter selected, which is downloaded or not. This is frustrating when using the _select all_ options for chapters and then immediately selecting delete. After the _select all_ option a lag spike happens, which then changes the snackbar but the input on the screen does not hit the delete button but the download button.

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Device information:**
 - OS:  android 8
 - App Version: r2186

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu

3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

 issue_title: [F-R] Snackbar Resizing Depending on Downloaded Chapters 
 issue_body: **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The snackbar resizes itself depending on whether there is a chapter selected, which is downloaded or not. This is frustrating when using the _select all_ options for chapters and then immediately selecting delete. After the _select all_ option a lag spike happens, which then changes the snackbar but the input on the screen does not hit the delete button but the download button.

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

                        commit_summarization: In the altered method, instead of using `indexOfFirst` to get the index of the first unread or unread chapter, the method uses `firstOrNull` to retrieve the first occurrence of an unread/unread chapter, and assigns the index of that chapter to the output variable.

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

Add advanced true delete option to completely remove a chapter

Sometimes a website adds a chapter then deletes it, causing shosetsu to
 bug when trying to load it. This allows a user to obliterate an
 offending chapter.

The snackbar resizes itself depending on whether there is a chapter selected, which is downloaded or not. This is frustrating when using the _select all_ options for chapters and then immediately selecting delete. After the _select all_ option a lag spike happens, which then changes the snackbar but the input on the screen does not hit the delete button but the download button.

4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

Given a commit that modifies the Snackbar behavior to no longer resize based on the number of downloaded chapters, we can measure the similarity to the provided issue as follows:

First, note that the issue title mentions "Snackbar Resizing Depending on Downloaded Chapters," which implies that the issue is related to the Snackbar and its resizing behavior, which is indeed also a concern in the commit.

Second, the issue body describes a specific issue with selecting and deleting chapters using the "select all" option and the Snackbar behavior lagging, causing the intended delete button press to register as a download button press instead. This behavior is addressed in the commit by removing the dependency of the Snackbar on the number of downloaded chapters.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the issue and the commit are closely related, if not identical. Therefore, the percentage of similarity would be:

100%

Note that any actual code changes or additional context may alter this assessment. The above analysis is based solely on the information provided in the issue title and body.</s>The attention mask and the pad token id were not set.

 issue_title: [F-R] Snackbar Resizing Depending on Downloaded Chapters 
 issue_body: **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The snackbar resizes itself depending on whether there is a chapter selected, which is downloaded or not. This is frustrating when using the _select all_ options for chapters and then immediately selecting delete. After the _select all_ option a lag spike happens, which then changes the snackbar but the input on the screen does not hit the delete button but the download button.

The snackbar always shows the download and delete option. Optionally it grays them out until they are usable.

 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

                        commit_summarization: In the altered method, instead of using `indexOfFirst` to get the index of the first unread or unread chapter, the method uses `firstOrNull` to retrieve the first occurrence of an unread/unread chapter, and assigns the index of that chapter to the output variable.

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view

 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

Both the issue and commit involve the use of the back button, but the specific behavior described in the issue and the change in the commit do not perfectly align. The issue describes duplicate novels appearing when navigating away from a novel and back, while the commit changelog describes a call to `onBackPressed()` being moved. While there is some relation between these two, they are not identical. Additionally, the commit changelog mentions a specific extension being tested, which is not mentioned in the issue.</s>

Before changes: The method calculated the total cost of an order by multiplying the number of items in the order by the price of each item and then adding a tax.

After changes: The method now calculates the total cost of an order by adding the price of each item to a running total, and then applies tax to the final cost.

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

Both the issue and commit mention the selection of a novel and the behavior that occurs after going back to the listing view. However, the issue focuses on the duplicate novels and additional novels not loading in the listing view, while the commit describes changes to the method affecting the visibility of menu items. Thus, while there is some overlap in the concepts, the specific details of the problem and the solution are not an exact match.</s>

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

 - OS: Android 11
 - App Version: 1656

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

response:  <s> [INST] Given an issue's details and a  commit's method change summarization, give me a percentage of similarity between the commit and the issue if they are talking about the same thing. Do not output any explanation . Here are some examples:

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

                        commit_summarization: In the altered method, instead of using `indexOfFirst` to get the index of the first unread or unread chapter, the method uses `firstOrNull` to retrieve the first occurrence of an unread/unread chapter, and assigns the index of that chapter to the output variable.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view

7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

Both the issue and the commit involve fixing/changing the behavior of an exception in the app. However, the specifics of the exceptions and their handlings differ in the two cases. The issue is about an exception causing duplicate novels in a listing view, while the commit changes the exception handling to hide the progress indicator and display an error snackbar instead of logging the exception.</s>

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

**Device information:**
 - OS: Android 11
 - App Version: 1656

response:  <s> [INST] Given an issue's details and a  commit's method change summarization, give me a percentage of similarity between the commit and the issue if they are talking about the same thing. Do not output any explanation . Here are some examples:
                    INPUT:
						issue_title: "[Bug] [2186]'Teleportation' to chapter when you click the resume button is wrong if the sort is the oppisite"

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

                        commit_summarization: In the altered method, instead of using `indexOfFirst` to get the index of the first unread or unread chapter, the method uses `firstOrNull` to retrieve the first occurrence of an unread/unread chapter, and assigns the index of that chapter to the output variable.

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

**Screenshots**

 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

response:  <s> [INST] Given an issue's details and a  commit's method change summarization, give me a percentage of similarity between the commit and the issue if they are talking about the same thing. Do not output any explanation . Here are some examples:
                    INPUT:
						issue_title: "[Bug] [2186]'Teleportation' to chapter when you click the resume button is wrong if the sort is the oppisite"

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

**Device information:**
 - OS: Android 11
 - App Version: 1656

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

**Device information:**
 - OS: Android 11
 - App Version: 1656 
summarization:  The changes in the method resulted in the cancellation message being updated from "Extension already installed" to "Extension install task over". Additionally, the error reporting logic for non-HTTP exceptions has been modified to not suppress them by default. All other functionality remains the same.</s>  The before version cancels the image load job when an extension is already installed, while the after version cancels when the extension installation task is completed. In summary, the alteration changes the reason for cancelling the image load job.</s>  [/INST] OUTPUT: 30%.

The issue is about a duplication bug in the novel listing view, while the commit summarization is about a change in the cancellation message of an extension's image load job. The two topics do not directly relate to each other. The percentage represents the level of similarity between the issue and commit, which is quite low in this case.</s>

<s> [INST] Given an issue's details and a  commit's method change summarization, give me a percentage of similarity between the commit and the issue if they are talking about the same thing. Do not output any explanation . Here are some examples:
                    INPUT:
						issue_title: "[Bug] [2186]'Teleportation' to chapter when you click the resume button is wrong if the sort is the oppisite"
                        issue_body: "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75091899/170125379-289b87c2-a4be-4a93-bab1-67885cf3815c.mp4

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

                        commit_summarization: In the altered method, instead of using `indexOfFirst` to get the index of the first unread or unread chapter, the method uses `firstOrNull` to retrieve the first occurrence of an unread/unread chapter, and assigns the index of that chapter to the output variable.
                        
                    OUTPUT: 100%.

                    issue_body: "**Describe the bug**
The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

**Screenshots**
I'm getting tired from typing extra details... it should be fine.... maybe?

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

**Device information:**
 - OS: Android 11
 - App Version: 1656 
summarization:  [/INST] "Method to retrieve novels in listing view is called multiple times, causing duplication of novels when user navigates back."

OUTPUT: 50%.

This commit summarization mentions the retrieval of novels in a method, which is also related to the issue described in the issue body regarding the duplication of novels in the listing view. However, it does not perfectly align with the issue as it only addresses one aspect of the problem, and does not directly address the reason why additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out. So, the similarity percentage is set to 50%.</s>

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

OUTPUT: 25%.

Explanation:

The issue and the commit describe different aspects of the codebase. The issue is about a bug related to the behavior of the listing view in the app, while the commit is about a method change that alters the way the previously selected novel index is retrieved.

While the commit may indirectly affect the behavior of the listing view, it does not directly address the bug described in the issue. The issue is about duplicating novels in the listing view and the loading behavior in an incrementing listing view, whereas the commit only modifies the implementation of a method.

Therefore, the similarity between the commit and the issue is low, with approximately 25% similarity.</s>

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

**Device information:**
 - OS: Android 11
 - App Version: 1656

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

Without the code of the commit, it's impossible to give a percentage of similarity between the issue and the commit. The issue and the commit describe different things. The issue is a bug report detailing a behavior in the app, while the commit summary is a description of what the commit does to the code.

In this particular case, the commit summary does not provide any information about the potential impact on the described bug, so it's not possible to determine any level of similarity.</s>

The issue description describes the issue as occurring when the user selects and goes back to a novel in a listing view, and mentions additional novels not loading without selecting a novel first. The commit summarization, on the other hand, describes the change in the method as involving a check for a specific bool value before continuing with the method, and returning early if the value is false. However, neither the issue description nor the commit summarization explicitly mention that the bug and change are related to each other. Therefore, while there is some overlap in the concepts discussed, they do not fully align and can be considered as only half similar.</s>

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

 - OS: Android 11
 - App Version: 1656

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

summarization:  [/INST] In the investigated commit, the method responsible for loading novels in the listing view has been refactored. Instead of using a single call to loadAllNovels, it now uses a call to loadMoreNovels and sets the threshold for loading more novels to the end of the list. As a result, the initial loading of novels in the listing view does not include all novels, and going back to the listing view results in loading the remaining novels. This behavior is different from the expected behavior described in the issue report where all novels should be loaded initially and going back to the listing view should not duplicate the novels.

Based on the provided info, the percentage of similarity between the commit and the issue is: 30%.

The commit and the issue are related to the same component (listing view) but the issue is concerning the behavior when going back to the listing view after selecting a novel, while the commit introduced a change in the loading mechanism of novels in the listing view.</s>

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

response:  <s> [INST] Given an issue's details and a  commit's method change summarization, give me a percentage of similarity between the commit and the issue if they are talking about the same thing. Do not output any explanation . Here are some examples:

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

response:  <s> [INST] Given an issue's details and a  commit's method change summarization, give me a percentage of similarity between the commit and the issue if they are talking about the same thing. Do not output any explanation . Here are some examples:

idk how to descrive it but here is the video

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. pick a novel with a lot of chapters
2. mark as read 2/3 of the total amount
3. reverse the sort direction of chapters
4. click resume button
you will see for a second that tha app teleported to the wrong chapter (it should be the last read one 1004, but it teleporter at the end of the video to 473, visually)

**Expected behavior**
the app teleported to the wrong chapter (visually) but it opened the right chapter so the bug is that the short animation where the app teleport to the actual chapter is wrong if the sort direction is the opposite from the default one

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Device information:**
 - OS:  android 8

                        commit_summarization: In the altered method, instead of using `indexOfFirst` to get the index of the first unread or unread chapter, the method uses `firstOrNull` to retrieve the first occurrence of an unread/unread chapter, and assigns the index of that chapter to the output variable.

The menu button to migrate a novel's source to a another source seems to be broken.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open Shosetsu
2. Install at least two extensions
3.  Add a novel (a novel within both shouldn't be necessary)
4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

4. Enter the added novel's chapter list view
5. Click or tap the overflow menu within the novel chapter list view
6. Click or tap the "Migrate source" overflow menu option
7. Experience the suck. Then embrace the suck. A worldview needed for almost everything in life for those who experience sucky situations or events.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is for the user to be able to migrate sources for a novel without experiencing setbacks.

**Screenshots**
I'm getting tired from typing extra details... it should be fine.... maybe?

 issue_title: [Bug] [1656] Novels in Listing View Duplicating 
 issue_body: **Describe the bug**
Selecting a novel of the listing and going back to the listing duplicates all novels.
Further, additional novels only load after selecting a novel and backing out.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Select an extension (tested with AsianHobbyist (non-incrementing listing) and ReadLightNovel (incrementing listing)).
2. Select any novel.
3. Hit the back button.
4. See the novels duplicated in the listing view.
5. See more novels appearing when scrolling down in a incremental listing view.

**Expected behavior**
Going back from a novel should not duplicate the novels in the listing view.
Further, in a incremental listing view additional novels should load without having to select a novel first.

**Device information:**
 - OS: Android 11
 - App Version: 1656 
summarization:  [/INST] The commit does not provide any information related to the duplication of novels in listing view or the unexpected behavior of loading additional novels only after selecting a novel. Therefore, the output should be 0%.</s>
